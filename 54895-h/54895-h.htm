GREENOW</a></h3>

<h4 class="first" id="Farcical_01">I</h4>

<p class="noindent">T<small>HE</small> most sumptuous present that Millicent received on
her seventh birthday was a doll’s house. “With love to darling little Mill from Aunty
Loo.” Aunt Loo was immensely rich, and the doll’s house was almost as grandiose and
massive as herself.</p>

<p>It was divided into four rooms, each papered in a different colour and each furnished
as was fitting: beds and washstands and wardrobes in the upstair rooms, arm-chairs and
artificial plants below. “Replete with every modern convenience; sumptuous appointments.”
There was even a cold collation ready spread on the dining-room table—two scarlet lobsters
on a dish, and a ham that <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-2">[Pg
2]</a></span>had been sliced into just enough to reveal an internal complexion of the
loveliest pink and white. One might go on talking about the doll’s house for ever, it was
so beautiful. Such, at any rate, was the opinion of Millicent’s brother Dick. He would
spend hours opening and shutting the front door, peeping through the windows, arranging
and rearranging the furniture. As for Millicent, the gorgeous present left her cold. She
had been hoping—and, what is more, praying, fervently, every night for a month—that Aunty
Loo would give her a toy sewing-machine (one of the kind that works, though) for her
birthday.</p>

<p>She was bitterly disappointed when the doll’s house came instead. But she bore it all
stoically and managed to be wonderfully polite to Aunty Loo about the whole affair. She
never looked at the doll’s house: it simply didn’t interest her.</p>

<p>Dick had already been at a preparatory school for a couple of terms. Mr. Killigrew, the
headmaster, thought him a promising boy. “Has quite a remarkable aptitude for
mathematics,” he wrote in his report. “He has started Algebra <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-3">[Pg 3]</a></span>this term and shows a”—“quite remarkable”
scratched out (the language of reports is apt to be somewhat limited)—“a very unusual
grasp of the subject.” Mr. Killigrew didn’t know that his pupil also took an interest in
dolls: if he had, he would have gibed at Dick as unmercifully and in nearly the same terms
as Dick’s fellow-schoolboys—for shepherds grow to resemble their sheep and pedagogues
their childish charges. But of course Dick would never have dreamt of telling anyone at
school about it. He was chary of letting even the people at home divine his weakness, and
when anyone came into the room where the doll’s house was, he would put his hands in his
pockets and stroll out, whistling the tune of, “There is a Happy Land far, far away, where
they have Ham and Eggs seven times a day,” as though he had merely stepped in to have a
look at the beastly thing—just to give it a kick.</p>

<p>When he wasn’t playing with the doll’s house, Dick spent his holiday time in reading,
largely, devouringly. No length or incomprehensibility could put him off; he had swallowed
down <i>Robert Elsmere</i> in <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg
4]</a></span>the three-volume edition at the age of eight. When he wasn’t reading he used
to sit and think about Things in General and Nothing in Particular; in fact, as Millicent
reproachfully put it, he just mooned about. Millicent, on the other hand, was always
busily doing something: weeding in the garden, or hoeing, or fruit-picking (she could be
trusted not to eat more than the recognized tariff—one in twenty raspberries or one in
forty plums); helping Kate in the kitchen; knitting mufflers for those beings known
vaguely as The Cripples, while her mother read aloud in the evenings before bedtime. She
disapproved of Dick’s mooning, but Dick mooned all the same.</p>

<p>When Dick was twelve and a half he knew enough about mathematics and history and the
dead languages to realize that his dear parents were profoundly ignorant and uncultured.
But, what was more pleasing to the dear parents, he knew enough to win a scholarship at
Æsop College, which is one of our Greatest Public Schools.</p>

<p>If this were a Public School story, I should record the fact that, while at <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-5">[Pg 5]</a></span>Æsop, Dick swore, lied,
blasphemed, repeated dirty stories, read the articles in <i>John Bull</i> about brothels
disguised as nursing-homes and satyrs disguised as curates; that he regarded his masters,
with very few exceptions, as fools, not even always well-meaning. And so on. All which
would be quite true, but beside the point. For this is not one of the conventional studies
of those clever young men who discover Atheism and Art at School, Socialism at the
University, and, passing through the inevitable stage of Sex and Syphilis after taking
their B.A., turn into maturely brilliant novelists at the age of twenty-five. I prefer,
therefore, to pass over the minor incidents of a difficult pubescence, touching only on
those points which seem to throw a light on the future career of our hero.</p>

<p>It is possible for those who desire it—incredible as the thing may appear—to learn
something at Æsop College. Dick even learnt a great deal. From the beginning he was the
young Benjamin of his mathematical tutor, Mr. Skewbauld, a man of great abilities in his
own art, and who, though wholly incapable of keeping <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-6">[Pg 6]</a></span>a form in order, could make his private
tuition a source of much profit to a mathematically minded boy. Mr. Skewbauld’s house was
the worst in Æsop: Dick described it as a mixture between a ghetto and a home for the
mentally deficient, and when he read in Sir Thomas Browne that it was a Vulgar Error to
suppose that Jews stink, he wrote a letter to the <i>School Magazine</i> exploding that
famous doctor as a quack and a charlatan, whose statements ran counter to the manifest
facts of everyday life in Mr. Skewbauld’s house. It may seem surprising that Dick should
have read Sir Thomas Browne at all. But he was more than a mere mathematician. He filled
the ample leisure, which is Æsop’s most precious gift to those of its Alumni who know how
to use it, with much and varied reading in history, in literature, in physical science,
and in more than one foreign language. Dick was something of a prodigy.</p>

<p>“Greenow’s an intellectual,” was Mr. Copthorne-Slazenger’s contemptuous verdict. “I
have the misfortune to have two or three intellectuals in my house. <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-7">[Pg 7]</a></span>They’re all of them
friends of his. I think he’s a Bad Influence in the School.” Copthorne-Slazenger regarded
himself as the perfect example of <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i>, the soul of an English
gentleman in the body of a Greek god. Unfortunately his legs were rather too short and his
lower lip was underhung like a salmon’s.</p>

<p>Dick had, indeed, collected about him a band of kindred spirits. There was Partington,
who specialized in history; Gay, who had read all the classical writings of the golden age
and was engaged in the study of mediæval Latin; Fletton, who was fantastically clever and
had brought the art of being idle to a pitch never previously reached in the annals of
Æsop. These were his chief friends, and a queer-looking group they made—Dick, small and
dark and nervous; Partington, all roundness, and whose spectacles were two moons in a
moonface; Gay, with the stiff walk of a little old man; and Fletton, who looked like
nobody so much as Mr. Jingle, tall and thin with a twisted, comical face.</p>

<p>“An ugly skulking crew,” Copthorne-Slazenger, <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span>conscious of his own Olympian splendour, would say as he saw
them pass.</p>

<p>With these faithful friends Dick should have been—and indeed for the most part was—very
happy. Between them they mustered up a great stock of knowledge; they could discuss every
subject under the sun. They were a liberal education and an amusement to one another.
There were times, however, when Dick was filled with a vague, but acute, discontent. He
wanted something which his friends could not give him; but what, but what? The discontent
rankled under the surface, like a suppressed measles. It was Lord Francis Quarles who
brought it out and made the symptoms manifest.</p>

<p>Francis Quarles was a superb creature, with the curly forehead of a bull and the face
and limbs of a Græco-Roman statue. It was a sight worth seeing when he looked down through
half-shut eyelids, in his usual attitude of sleepy arrogance, on the world about him. He
was in effect what Mr. Copthorne-Slazenger imagined himself to be, and he shared that
gentleman’s dislike for Dick and his <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-9">[Pg 9]</a></span>friends. “Yellow little atheists,” he called them. He always
stood up for God and the Church of England; they were essential adjuncts to the
aristocracy. God, indeed, was almost a member of the Family; lack of belief in Him
amounted to a personal insult to the name of Quarles.</p>

<p>It was half-way through the summer term, when Dick was sixteen, on one of those days of
brilliant sunshine and cloudless blue, when the sight of beautiful and ancient buildings
is peculiarly poignant. Their age and quiet stand out in melancholy contrast against the
radiant life of the summer; and at Æsop the boys go laughing under their antique shadow;
“Little victims”—you feel how right Gray was. Dick was idly strolling across the
quadrangle, engaged in merely observing the beauty about him—the golden-grey chapel, with
its deep geometrical shadows between the buttresses, the comely rose-coloured shapes of
the brick-built Tudor buildings, the weathercocks glittering in the sun, the wheeling
flurries of pigeons. His old discontent had seized on him again, and to-day in <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-10">[Pg 10]</a></span>the presence of all this
beauty it had become almost unbearable. All at once, out of the mouth of one of the dark
little tunnelled doors pierced in the flanks of the sleeping building, a figure emerged
into the light. It was Francis Quarles, clad in white flannels and the radiance of the
sunshine. He appeared like a revelation, bright, beautiful, and sudden, before Dick’s
eyes. A violent emotion seized him; his heart leapt, his bowels were moved within him; he
felt a little sick and faint—he had fallen in love.</p>

<p>Francis passed by without deigning to notice him. His head was high, his eyes drowsy
under their drooping lids. He was gone, and for Dick all the light was out, the beloved
quadrangle was a prison-yard, the pigeons a loathsome flock of carrion eaters. Gay and
Partington came up behind him with shouts of invitation. Dick walked rudely away. God! how
he hated them and their wretched, silly talk and their yellow, ugly faces.</p>

<p>The weeks that followed were full of strangeness. For the first time in his <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-11">[Pg 11]</a></span>life Dick took to
writing poetry. There was one sonnet which began:</p>

<p class="noindent">He kept on repeating the words to himself, “Sylvan haunts in Arcady,”
“laugh and loiter” (after much thought he had adopted that as more liquidly melodious than
“sing and saunter”). How beautiful they sounded!—as beautiful as Keats—more beautiful, for
they were his own.</p>

<p>He avoided the company of Gay and Fletton and Partington; they had become odious to
him, and their conversation, when he could bring himself to listen to it, was, somehow,
almost incomprehensible. He would sit for hours alone in his study; not working—for he
could not understand the mathematical problems on which he had been engaged before the
fateful day in the quadrangle—but reading novels and the poetry of Mrs. Browning, and at
intervals <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-12">[Pg 12]</a></span>writing
something rather ecstatic of his own. After a long preparatory screwing up of his courage,
he dared at last to send a fag with a note to Francis, asking him to tea; and when Francis
rather frigidly refused, he actually burst into tears. He had not cried like that since he
was a child.</p>

<p>He became suddenly very religious. He would spend an hour on his knees every night,
praying, praying with frenzy. He mortified the flesh with fasting and watching. He even
went so far as to flagellate himself—or at least tried to; for it is very difficult to
flagellate yourself adequately with a cane in a room so small that any violent gesture
imperils the bric-à-brac. He would pass half the night stark naked, in absurd postures,
trying to hurt himself. And then, after the dolorously pleasant process of self-maceration
was over, he used to lean out of the window and listen to the murmurs of the night and
fill his spirit with the warm velvet darkness of midsummer. Copthorne-Slazenger, coming
back by the late train from town one night, happened to see his moon-pale face hanging
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-13">[Pg 13]</a></span>out of window and
was delighted to be able to give him two hundred Greek lines to remind him that even a
member of the Sixth Form requires sleep sometimes.</p>

<p>The fit lasted three weeks. “I can’t think what’s the matter with you, Greenow,”
complained Mr. Skewbauld snufflingly. “You seem incapable or unwilling to do anything at
all. I suspect the cause is constipation. If only everyone would take a little paraffin
every night before going to bed! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Mr. Skewbauld’s self-imposed mission in
life was the propagation of the paraffin habit. It was the universal panacea—the cure for
every ill.</p>

<p>His friends of before the crisis shook their heads and could only suppose him mad. And
then the fit ended as suddenly as it had begun.</p>

<p>It happened at a dinner-party given by the Cravisters. Dr. Cravister was the Headmaster
of Æsop—a good, gentle, learned old man, with snow-white hair and a saintly face which the
spirit of comic irony had embellished with a nose that might, so red and bulbous it was,
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span>have been borrowed
from the properties of a music-hall funny man. And then there was Mrs. Cravister, large
and stately as a galleon with all sails set. Those who met her for the first time might be
awed by the dignity of what an Elizabethan would have called her “swelling port.” But
those who knew her well went in terror of the fantastic spirit which lurked behind the
outward majesty. They were afraid of what that richly modulated voice of hers might utter.
It was not merely that she was malicious—and she had a gift of ever-ready irony; no, what
was alarming in all her conversation was the element of the unexpected. With most people
one feels comfortably secure that they will always say the obvious and ordinary things;
with Mrs. Cravister, never. The best one could do was to be on guard and to try and look,
when she made a more than usually characteristic remark, less of a bewildered fool than
one felt.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cravister received her guests—they were all of them boys—with stately courtesy.
They found it pleasant to be taken so seriously, to be treated as <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-15">[Pg 15]</a></span>perfectly grown men; but at the same time,
they always had with Mrs. Cravister a faint uncomfortable suspicion that all her
politeness was an irony so exquisite as to be practically undistinguishable from
ingenuousness.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Gay,” she said, holding out her hand and shutting her eyes; it was
one of her disconcerting habits, this shutting of the eyes. “What a pleasure it will be to
hear you talking to us again about eschatology.”</p>

<p>Gay, who had never talked about eschatology and did not know the meaning of the word,
smiled a little dimly and made a protesting noise.</p>

<p>“Eschatology? What a charming subject!” The fluty voice belonged to Henry Cravister,
the Headmaster’s son, a man of about forty who worked in the British Museum. He was almost
too cultured, too erudite.</p>

<p>“But I don’t know anything about it,” said Gay desperately.</p>

<p>“Spare us your modesty,” Henry Cravister protested.</p>

<p>His mother shook hands with the other guests, putting some at their ease with a <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-16">[Pg 16]</a></span>charming phrase and
embarrassing others by saying something baffling and unexpected that would have dismayed
even the hardiest diner-out, much more a schoolboy tremblingly on his good behaviour. At
the tail end of the group of boys stood Dick and Francis Quarles. Mrs. Cravister slowly
raised her heavy waxen eyelids and regarded them a moment in silence.</p>

<p>“The Græco-Roman and the Gothic side by side!” she exclaimed. “Lord Francis is
something in the Vatican, a rather late piece of work; and Mr. Greenow is a little
gargoyle from the roof of Notre Dame de Paris. Two epochs of art—how clearly one sees the
difference. And my husband, I always think, is purely Malayan in design—purely Malayan,”
she repeated as she shook hands with the two boys.</p>

<p>Dick blushed to the roots of his hair, but Francis’ impassive arrogance remained
unmoved. Dick stole a glance in his direction, and at the sight of his calm face he felt a
new wave of adoring admiration sweeping through him.</p>

<p>The company was assembled and complete, Mrs. Cravister looked round the <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-17">[Pg 17]</a></span>room and remarking, “We
won’t wait for Mr. Copthorne-Slazenger,” sailed majestically in the direction of the door.
She particularly disliked this member of her husband’s staff, and lost no opportunity of
being rude to him. Thus, where an ordinary hostess might have said, “Shall we come in to
dinner?” Mrs. Cravister employed the formula, “We won’t wait for Mr. Copthorne-Slazenger”;
and a guest unacquainted with Mrs. Cravister’s habits would be surprised on entering the
dining-room to find that all the seats at the table were filled, and that the meal
proceeded smoothly without a single further reference to the missing Copthorne, who never
turned up at all, for the good reason that he had never been invited.</p>

<p>Dinner began a little nervously and uncomfortably. At one end of the table the
Headmaster was telling anecdotes of Æsop in the sixties, at which the boys in his
neighbourhood laughed with a violent nervous insincerity. Henry Cravister, still talking
about eschatology, was quoting from Sidonius Apollinarius and Commodianus of Gaza. Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-18">[Pg 18]</a></span>Cravister, who had
been engaged in a long colloquy with the butler, suddenly turned on Dick with the remark,
“And so you have a deep, passionate fondness for cats,” as though they had been intimately
discussing the subject for the last hour. Dick had enough presence of mind to say that,
yes, he did like cats—all except those Manx ones that had no tails.</p>

<p>“No tails,” Mrs. Cravister repeated—“no tails. Like men. How symbolical everything
is!”</p>

<p>Francis Quarles was sitting opposite him, so that Dick had ample opportunity to look at
his idol. How perfectly he did everything, down to eating his soup! The first lines of a
new poem began to buzz in Dick’s head:</p>

<blockquote class="verse">
<p class="i1">“All, all I lay at thy proud marble feet—</p>

<p class="i1a">My heart, my love and all my future days.</p>

<p class="i1a">Upon thy brow for ever let me gaze,</p>

<p class="i1a">For ever touch thy hair: oh (something) sweet .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Would he be able to find enough rhymes to make it into a sonnet? Mrs.
Cravister, who had been leaning back in her chair for the last few minutes in a <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-19">[Pg 19]</a></span>state of exhausted
abstraction, opened her eyes and said to nobody in particular:</p>

<p>“Ah, how I envy the calm of those Chinese dynasties!”</p>

<p>“Which Chinese dynasties?” a well-meaning youth inquired.</p>

<p>“Any Chinese dynasty, the more remote the better. Henry, tell us the names of some
Chinese dynasties.”</p>

<p>In obedience to his mother, Henry delivered a brief disquisition on the history of
politics, art, and letters in the Far East.</p>

<p>The Headmaster continued his reminiscences.</p>

<p>An angel of silence passed. The boys, whose shyness had begun to wear off, became
suddenly and painfully conscious of hearing themselves eating. Mrs. Cravister saved the
situation.</p>

<p>“Lord Francis knows all about birds,” she said in her most thrilling voice. “Perhaps he
can tell us why it is the unhappy fate of the carrion crow to mate for life.”</p>

<p>Conversation again became general. Dick was still thinking about his sonnet. Oh, these
rhymes!—praise, bays, roundelays, <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span>amaze: greet, bleat, defeat, beat, paraclete.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<blockquote class="verse">
<p class="i1">“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to sing the praise</p>

<p class="i1a">In anthems high and solemn roundelays</p>

<p class="i1a">Of Holy Father, Son and Paraclete.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">That was good—damned good; but it hardly seemed to fit in with the
first quatrain. It would do for one of his religious poems, though. He had written a lot
of sacred verse lately.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, cutting across his ecstatic thoughts, came the sound of Henry
Cravister’s reedy voice.</p>

<p>“But I always find Pater’s style so <i>coarse</i>,” it said.</p>

<p>Something explosive took place in Dick’s head. It often happens when one blows one’s
nose that some passage in the labyrinth connecting ears and nose and throat is momentarily
blocked, and one becomes deaf and strangely dizzy. Then, suddenly, the mucous bubble
bursts, sound rushes back to the brain, the head feels clear and stable once more. It was
something like this, but transposed into terms of the spirit, that seemed now to have
happened to Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>It was as though some mysterious obstruction in his brain, which had dammed up and
diverted his faculties from their normal course during the past three weeks, had been on a
sudden overthrown. His life seemed to be flowing once more along familiar channels.</p>

<p>He was himself again.</p>

<p>“But I always find Pater’s style so <i>coarse</i>.”</p>

<p>These few words of solemn foolery were the spell which had somehow performed the
miracle. It was just the sort of remark he might have made three weeks ago, before the
crisis. For a moment, indeed, he almost thought it was he himself who had spoken; his own
authentic voice, carried across the separating gulf of days, had woken him again to
life!</p>

<p>He looked at Francis Quarles. Why, the fellow was nothing but a great prize ox, a
monstrous animal. “There was a Lady loved a Swine. Honey, said she .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” It was
ignoble, it was ridiculous. He could have hidden his face in his hands for pure shame;
shame tingled through his body. Goodness, how grotesquely he had behaved!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>He leaned across and began talking to Henry Cravister about Pater and style and books
in general. Cravister was amazed at the maturity of the boy’s mind; for he possessed to a
remarkable degree that critical faculty which in the vast majority of boys is—and from
their lack of experience must be—wholly lacking.</p>

<p>“You must come and see me some time when you’re in London,” Henry Cravister said to him
when the time came for the boys to get back to their houses. Dick was flattered; he had
not said that to any of the others. He walked home with Gay, laughing and talking quite in
his old fashion. Gay marvelled at the change in his companion; strange, inexplicable
fellow! but it was pleasant to have him back again, to repossess the lost friend. Arrived
in his room, Dick sat down to attack the last set of mathematical problems that had been
set him. Three hours ago they had appeared utterly incomprehensible; now he understood
them perfectly. His mind was like a giant refreshed, delighting in its strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day Mr. Skewbauld congratulated him on his answers.</p>

<p>“You seem quite to have recovered your old form, Greenow,” he said. “Did you take my
advice? Paraffin regularly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Looking back on the events of the last weeks, Dick was disquieted. Mr. Skewbauld might
be wrong in recommending paraffin, but he was surely right in supposing that something was
the matter and required a remedy. What could it be? He felt so well; but that, of course,
proved nothing. He began doing Müller’s exercises, and he bought a jar of malt extract and
a bottle of hypophosphites. After much consultation of medical handbooks and the
encyclopædia, he came to the conclusion that he was suffering from anæmia of the brain;
and for some time one fixed idea haunted him: Suppose the blood completely ceased to flow
to his brain, suppose he were to fall down suddenly dead or, worse, become utterly and
hopelessly paralysed. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Happily the distractions of Æsop in the summer term
were sufficiently numerous and delightful to <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-24">[Pg 24]</a></span>divert his mind from this gloomy brooding, and he felt so
well and in such high spirits that it was impossible to go on seriously believing that he
was at death’s door. Still, whenever he thought of the events of those strange weeks he
was troubled. He did not like being confronted by problems which he could not solve.
During the rest of his stay at school he was troubled by no more than the merest
velleities of a relapse. A fit of moon-gazing and incapacity to understand the higher
mathematics had threatened him one time when he was working rather too strenuously for a
scholarship. But a couple of days’ complete rest had staved off the peril. There had been
rather a painful scene, too, at Dick’s last School Concert. Oh, those Æsop concerts!
Musically speaking, of course, they are deplorable; but how rich from all other points of
view than the merely æsthetic! The supreme moment arrives at the very end when three of
the most eminent and popular of those about to leave mount the platform together and sing
the famous “Æsop, Farewell.” Greatest of school <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-25">[Pg 25]</a></span>songs! The words are not much, but the tune, which goes
swooning along in three-four time, is perhaps the masterpiece of the late organist, Dr.
Pilch.</p>

<p>Dick was leaving, but he was not a sufficiently heroic figure to have been asked to
sing, “Æsop, Farewell.” He was simply a member of the audience, and one, moreover, who had
come to the concert in a critical and mocking spirit. For, as he had an ear for music, it
was impossible for him to take the concert very seriously. The choir had clamorously
re-crucified the Messiah; the soloists had all done their worst; and now it was time for
“Æsop, Farewell.” The heroes climbed on to the stage. They were three demi-gods, but
Francis Quarles was the most splendid of the group as he stood there with head thrown
back, eyes almost closed, calm and apparently unconscious of the crowd that seethed,
actually and metaphorically, beneath him. He was wearing an enormous pink orchid in the
buttonhole of his evening coat; his shirt-front twinkled with diamond studs; the buttons
of his waistcoat were of fine <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-26">[Pg
26]</a></span>gold. At the sight of him, Dick felt his heart beating violently; he was
not, he painfully realized, master of himself.</p>

<p>The music struck up—Dum, dum, dumdidi, dumdidi; dum, dum, dum, and so on. So like the
<i>Merry Widow.</i> In two days’ time he would have left Æsop for ever. The prospect had
never affected him very intensely. He had enjoyed himself at school, but he had never,
like so many Æsopians, fallen in love with the place. It remained for him an institution;
for others it was almost an adored person. But to-night his spirit, rocked on a treacly
ocean of dominant sevenths, succumbed utterly to the sweet sorrow of parting. And there on
the platform stood Francis. Oh, how radiantly beautiful! And when he began, in his rich
tenor, the first verse of the Valedictory:</p>

<blockquote class="verse">
<p class="i2">“Farewell, Mother Æsop,</p>

<p class="i3a">Our childhood’s home!</p>

<p class="i2a">Our spirit is with thee,</p>

<p class="i3a">Though far we roam .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">he found himself hysterically sobbing.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<h4 id="Farcical_02">II</h4>

<p class="noindent">C<small>ANTELOUP</small> C<small>OLLEGE</small> is perhaps the most
frightful building in Oxford—and to those who know their Oxford well this will mean not a
little. Up till the middle of last century Canteloup possessed two quadrangles of
fifteenth-century buildings, unimpressive and petty, like so much of College architecture,
but at least quiet, unassuming, decent. After the accession of Victoria the College began
to grow in numbers, wealth, and pride. The old buildings were too small and unpretentious
for what had now become a Great College. In the summer of 1867 a great madness fell upon
the Master and Fellows. They hired a most distinguished architect, bred up in the school
of Ruskin, who incontinently razed all the existing buildings to the ground and erected in
their stead a vast pile in the approved Mauro-Venetian Gothic of the period. The New
Buildings contained a great number of rooms, each served by a separate and almost
perpendicular staircase; and if nearly<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-28">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;[Pg 28]</a></span>half of them were so
dark as to make it necessary to light them artificially for all but three hours out of the
twenty-four, this slight defect was wholly outweighed by the striking beauty, from
outside, of the Neo-Byzantine loopholes by which they were, euphemistically,
“lighted.”</p>

<p>Prospects in Canteloup may not please; but man, on the other hand, tends to be less
vile there than in many other places. There is an equal profusion at Canteloup of Firsts
and Blues; there are Union orators of every shade of opinion and young men so languidly
well bred as to take no interest in politics of any kind; there are drinkers of cocoa and
drinkers of champagne. Canteloup is a microcosm, a whole world in miniature; and whatever
your temperament and habits may be, whether you wish to drink, or row, or work, or hunt,
Canteloup will provide you with congenial companions and a spiritual home.</p>

<p>Lack of athletic distinction had prevented Dick from being, at Æsop, a hero or anything
like one. At Canteloup, in a less barbarically ordered state of society, things were
different. His rooms in the <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-29">[Pg
29]</a></span>Venetian gazebo over the North Gate became the meeting-place of all that was
most intellectually distinguished in Canteloup and the University at large. He had had his
sitting-room austerely upholstered and papered in grey. A large white Chinese figure of
the best period stood pedestalled in one corner, and on the walls there hung a few
uncompromisingly good drawings and lithographs by modern artists. Fletton, who had
accompanied Dick from Æsop to Canteloup, called it the “cerebral chamber”; and with its
prevailing tone of brain-coloured grey and the rather dry intellectual taste of its
decorations it deserved the name.</p>

<p>To-night the cerebral chamber had been crammed. The Canteloup branch of the Fabian
Society, under Dick’s presidency, had been holding a meeting. “Art in the Socialist State”
was what they had been discussing. And now the meeting had broken up, leaving nothing but
three empty jugs that had once contained mulled claret and a general air of untidiness to
testify to its having taken place at all. Dick stood leaning an elbow on the mantelpiece
and absent-mindedly <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-30">[Pg
30]</a></span>kicking, to the great detriment of his pumps, at the expiring red embers in
the grate. From the depths of a huge and cavernous arm-chair, Fletton, pipe in mouth,
fumed like a sleepy volcano.</p>

<p>“I liked the way, Dick,” he said, with a laugh—“the way you went for the Arty-Crafties.
You utterly destroyed them.”</p>

<p>“I merely pointed out, what is sufficiently obvious, that crafts are not art, nor
anything like it, that’s all.” Dick snapped out the words. He was nervous and excited, and
his body felt as though it were full of compressed springs ready to jump at the most
imponderable touch. He was always like that after making a speech.</p>

<p>“You did it very effectively,” said Fletton. There was a silence between the two young
men.</p>

<p>A noise like the throaty yelling of savages in rut came wafting up from the quadrangle
on which the windows of the cerebral chamber opened. Dick started; all the springs within
him had gone off at once—a thousand simultaneous Jack-in-the-boxes.</p>

<p>“It’s only Francis Quarles’ dinner-party <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-31">[Pg 31]</a></span>becoming vocal,” Fletton explained. “Blind mouths, as
Milton would call them.”</p>

<p>Dick began restlessly pacing up and down the room. When Fletton spoke to him, he did
not reply or, at best, gave utterance to a monosyllable or a grunt.</p>

<p>“My dear Dick,” said the other at last, “you’re not very good company to-night,” and
heaving himself up from the arm-chair, Fletton went shuffling in his loose, heelless
slippers towards the door. “I’m going to bed.”</p>

<p>Dick paused in his lion-like prowling to listen to the receding sound of feet on the
stairs. All was silent now: Gott sei dank. He went into his bedroom. It was there that he
kept his piano, for it was a piece of furniture too smugly black and polished to have a
place in the cerebral chamber. He had been thirsting after his piano all the time Fletton
was sitting there, damn him! He drew up a chair and began to play over and over a certain
series of chords. With his left hand he struck an octave G in the base, while his right
dwelt lovingly on F, B, and E. A luscious chord, beloved by Mendelssohn—a chord in which
the native <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-32">[Pg
32]</a></span>richness of the dominant seventh is made more rich, more piercing sweet by
the addition of a divine discord. G, F, B, and E—he let the notes hang tremulously on the
silence, savoured to the full their angelic overtones; then, when the sound of the chord
had almost died away, he let it droop reluctantly through D to the simple, triumphal
beauty of C natural—the diapason closing full in what was for Dick a wholly ineffable
emotion.</p>

<p>He repeated that dying fall again and again, perhaps twenty times. Then, when he was
satiated with its deliciousness, he rose from the piano and opening the lowest drawer of
the wardrobe pulled out from under his evening clothes a large portfolio. He undid the
strings; it was full of photogravure reproductions from various Old Masters. There was an
almost complete set of Greuze’s works, several of the most striking Ary Scheffers, some
Alma Tadema, some Leighton, photographs of sculpture by Torwaldsen and Canova, Boecklin’s
“Island of the Dead,” religious pieces by Holman Hunt, and a large packet of miscellaneous
pictures from the Paris Salons of the last forty years. <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-33">[Pg 33]</a></span>He took them into the cerebral chamber
where the light was better, and began to study them, lovingly, one by one. The Cézanne
lithograph, the three admirable etchings by Van Gogh, the little Picasso looked on,
unmoved, from the walls.</p>

<p>It was three o’clock before Dick got to bed. He was stiff and cold, but full of the
satisfaction of having accomplished something. And, indeed, he had cause to be satisfied;
for he had written the first four thousand words of a novel, a chapter and a half of
<i>Heartsease Fitzroy: the Story of a Young Girl</i>.</p>

<p>Next morning Dick looked at what he had written overnight, and was alarmed. He had
never produced anything quite like this since the days of the Quarles incident at Æsop. A
relapse? He wondered. Not a serious one in any case; for this morning he felt himself in
full possession of all his ordinary faculties. He must have got overtired speaking to the
Fabians in the evening. He looked at his manuscript again, and read: “‘Daddy, do the
little girl angels in heaven have toys and kittens and teddy-bears?’</p>

<p>“‘I don’t know,’ said Sir Christopher <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-34">[Pg 34]</a></span>gently. ‘Why does my little one ask?’</p>

<p>“‘Because, daddy,” said the child—‘because I think that soon I too may be a little
angel, and I should so like to have my teddy-bear with me in heaven.’</p>

<p>“Sir Christopher clasped her to his breast. How frail she was, how ethereal, how nearly
an angel already! Would she have her teddy-bear in heaven? The childish question rang in
his ears. Great, strong man though he was, he was weeping. His tears fell in a rain upon
her auburn curls.</p>

<p>“‘Tell me, daddy,’ she insisted, ‘will dearest God allow me my teddy-bear?’</p>

<p>“‘My child,’ he sobbed, ‘my child .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’”</p>

<p>The blushes mounted hot to his cheeks; he turned away his head in horror. He would
really have to look after himself for a bit, go to bed early, take exercise, not do much
work. This sort of thing couldn’t be allowed to go on.</p>

<p>He went to bed at half-past nine that night, and woke up the following morning to find
that he had added a dozen or more closely written pages to his original <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-35">[Pg 35]</a></span>manuscript during the
night. He supposed he must have written them in his sleep. It was all very disquieting.
The days passed by; every morning a fresh instalment was added to the rapidly growing bulk
of <i>Heartsease Fitzroy</i>. It was as though some goblin, some Lob-lie-by-the-Fire, came
each night to perform the appointed task, vanishing before the morning. In a little while
Dick’s alarm wore off; during the day he was perfectly well; his mind functioned with
marvellous efficiency. It really didn’t seem to matter what he did in his sleep provided
he was all right in his waking hours. He almost forgot about <i>Heartsease</i>, and was
only reminded of her existence when by chance he opened the drawer in which the steadily
growing pile of manuscript reposed.</p>

<p>In five weeks <i>Heartsease Fitzroy</i> was finished. Dick made a parcel of the
manuscript and sent it to a literary agent. He had no hopes of any publisher taking the
thing; but he was in sore straits for money at the moment, and it seemed worth trying, on
the off-chance. A fortnight later Dick received a letter<span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-36">[Pg 36]</a></span> beginning: “D<small>EAR</small>
M<small>ADAM</small>,—Permit me to hail in you a new authoress of real talent.
<i>Heartsease Fitzroy</i> is G<small>REAT</small>,”—and signed “E<small>BOR</small> W.
S<small>IMS</small>, Editor, <i>Hildebrand’s Home Weekly</i>.”</p>

<p>Details of the circulation of <i>Hildebrand’s Home Weekly</i> were printed at the head
of the paper; its average net sale was said to exceed three and a quarter millions. The
terms offered by Mr. Sims seemed to Dick positively fabulous. And there would be the
royalties on the thing in book form after the serial had run its course.</p>

<p>The letter arrived at breakfast; Dick cancelled all engagements for the day and set out
immediately for a long and solitary walk. It was necessary to be alone, to think. He made
his way along the Seven Bridges Road, up Cumnor Hill, through the village, and down the
footpath to Bablock Hithe, thence to pursue the course of the “stripling Thames”—haunted
at every step by the Scholar Gipsy, damn him! He drank beer and ate some bread and cheese
in a little inn by a bridge, farther up the river; and it was there, in the inn <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-37">[Pg 37]</a></span>parlour, surrounded by
engravings of the late Queen, and breathing the slightly mouldy preserved air bottled some
three centuries ago into that hermetically sealed chamber—it was there that he solved the
problem, perceived the strange truth about himself.</p>

<p>He was a hermaphrodite.</p>

<p>A hermaphrodite, not in the gross obvious sense, of course, but spiritually. Two
persons in one, male and female. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde: or rather a new William Sharp
and Fiona MacLeod—a more intelligent William, a vulgarer Fiona. Everything was explained;
the deplorable Quarles incident was simple and obvious now. A sentimental young lady of
literary tastes writing sonnets to her Ouida guardsman. And what an unerring flair Mr.
Sims had shown by addressing him so roundly and unhesitatingly as “madam”!</p>

<p>Dick was elated at this discovery. He had an orderly mind that disliked mysteries. He
had been a puzzle to himself for a long time; now he was solved. He was not in the least
distressed to discover this abnormality in his character. <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-38">[Pg 38]</a></span>As long as the two parts of him kept well
apart, as long as his male self could understand mathematics, and as long as his lady
novelist’s self kept up her regular habit of writing at night and retiring from business
during the day, the arrangement would be admirable. The more he thought about it, the more
it seemed an ideal state of affairs. His life would arrange itself so easily and well. He
would devote the day to the disinterested pursuit of knowledge, to philosophy and
mathematics, with perhaps an occasional excursion into politics. After midnight he would
write novels with a feminine pen, earning the money that would make his unproductive male
labours possible. A kind of spiritual <i>souteneur</i>. But the fear of poverty need haunt
him no more; no need to become a wage-slave, to sacrifice his intelligence to the needs of
his belly. Like a gentleman of the East, he would sit still and smoke his philosophic pipe
while the womenfolk did the dirty work. Could anything be more satisfactory?</p>

<p>He paid for his bread and beer, and walked home, whistling as he went.</p>

<h4 id="Farcical_03">III</h4>

<p class="noindent">T<small>WO</small> months later the first instalment of <i>Heartsease
Fitzroy: the Story of a Young Girl</i>, by Pearl Bellairs, appeared in the pages of
<i>Hildebrand’s Home Weekly</i>. Three and a quarter millions read and approved. When the
story appeared in book form, two hundred thousand copies were sold in six weeks; and in
the course of the next two years no less than sixteen thousand female infants in London
alone were christened Heartsease. With her fourth novel and her two hundred and fiftieth
Sunday paper article, Pearl Bellairs was well on her way to becoming a household word.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dick was in receipt of an income far beyond the wildest dreams of his
avarice. He was able to realize the two great ambitions of his life—to wear silk
underclothing and to smoke good (but really good) cigars.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<h4 id="Farcical_04">IV</h4>

<p class="noindent">D<small>ICK</small> went down from Canteloup in a blaze of glory. The
most brilliant man of his generation, exceptional mind, prospects, career. But his head
was not turned. When people congratulated him on his academic successes, he thanked them
politely and then invited them to come and see his Memento Mori. His Memento Mori was
called Mr. Glottenham and could be found at any hour of the day in the premises of the
Union, or if it was evening, in the Senior Common Room at Canteloup. He was an old member
of the College, and the dons in pity for his age and loneliness had made him, some years
before, a member of their Common Room. This act of charity was as bitterly regretted as
any generous impulse in the history of the world. Mr. Glottenham made the life of the
Canteloup fellows a burden to them; he dined in Hall with fiendish regularity, never
missing a night, and he was always the last to leave the Common Room. Mr. Glottenham did
not prepossess at a first glance; <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-41">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;[Pg 41]</a></span>the furrows of his
face were covered with a short grey sordid stubble; his clothes were disgusting with the
spilth of many years of dirty feeding; he had the shoulders and long hanging arms of an
ape—an ape with a horribly human look about it. When he spoke, it was like the sound of a
man breaking coke; he spoke incessantly and on every subject. His knowledge was enormous;
but he possessed the secret of a strange inverted alchemy—he knew how to turn the richest
gold to lead, could make the most interesting topic so intolerably tedious that it was
impossible, when he talked, not to loathe it.</p>

<p>This was the death’s-head to which Dick, like an ancient philosopher at a banquet,
would direct the attention of his heartiest congratulators. Mr. Glottenham had had the
most dazzling academic career of his generation. His tutors had prophesied for him a
future far more brilliant than that of any of his contemporaries. They were now Ministers
of State, poets, philosophers, judges, millionaires. Mr. Glottenham frequented the Union
and the Canteloup <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-42">[Pg
42]</a></span>Senior Common Room, and was—well, he was just Mr. Glottenham. Which was why
Dick did not think too highly of his own laurels.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h4 id="Farcical_05">V</h4>

<p class="noindent">“W<small>HAT</small> shall I do? what ought I to do?” Dick walked up
and down the room smoking, furiously and without at all savouring its richness, one of his
opulent cigars.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said Cravister—for it was in Cravister’s high-ceilinged Bloomsbury room that
Dick was thus unveiling his distress of spirit—“my dear, this isn’t a revival meeting. You
speak as though there were an urgent need for your soul to be saved from hell fire. It’s
not as bad as that, you know.”</p>

<p>“But it <i>is</i> a revival meeting,” Dick shouted in exasperation—“it is. I’m a
revivalist. You don’t know what it’s like to have a feeling about your soul. I’m
terrifyingly earnest; you don’t seem to understand that. I have all the feelings of Bunyan
without his religion. I regard the salvation of my soul as important. <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-43">[Pg 43]</a></span>How simple everything
would be if one could go out with those creatures in bonnets and sing hymns like, ‘Hip,
hip for the blood of the Lamb, hurrah!’ or that exquisite one:</p>

<blockquote class="verse">
<p class="i1">“‘The bells of Hell ring tingalingaling</p>

<p class="i3">For you, but not for me.</p>

<p class="i1b">For me the angels singalingaling;</p>

<p class="i3">They’ve got the goods for me.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Unhappily it’s impossible.”</p>

<p>“Your ideas,” said Cravister in his flutiest voice, “are somewhat Gothic. I think I can
understand them, though of course I don’t sympathize or approve. My advice to people in
doubt about what course of action they ought to pursue is always the same: do what you
want to.”</p>

<p>“Cravister, you’re hopeless,” said Dick, laughing. “I suppose I am rather Gothic, but I
do feel that the question of ought as well as of want does arise.”</p>

<p>Dick had come to his old friend for advice about Life. What ought he to do? The
indefatigable pen of Pearl Bellairs solved for him the financial problem. There remained
only the moral problem: how could he best expend his energies and <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-44">[Pg 44]</a></span>his time? Should he devote himself to
knowing or doing, philosophy or politics? He felt in himself the desire to search for
truth and the ability—who knows?—to find it. On the other hand, the horrors of the world
about him seemed to call on him to put forth all his strength in an effort to ameliorate
what was so patently and repulsively bad. Actually, what had to be decided was this:
Should he devote himself to the researches necessary to carry out the plan, long ripening
in his brain, of a new system of scientific philosophy; or should he devote his powers and
Pearl Bellairs’ money in propaganda that should put life into the English revolutionary
movement? Great moral principles were in the balance. And Cravister’s advice was, do what
you want to!</p>

<p>After a month of painful indecision, Dick, who was a real Englishman, arrived at a
satisfactory compromise. He started work on his new Synthetic Philosophy, and at the same
time joined the staff of the <i>Weekly International</i>, to which he contributed both
money and articles. The weeks slipped pleasantly and profitably along. The secret of
happiness lies in <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-45">[Pg
45]</a></span>congenial work, and no one could have worked harder than Dick, unless it was
the indefatigable Pearl Bellairs, whose nightly output of five thousand words sufficed to
support not only Dick but the <i>Weekly International</i> as well. These months were
perhaps the happiest period of Dick’s life. He had friends, money, liberty; he knew
himself to be working well; and it was an extra, a supererogatory happiness that he began
at this time to get on much better with his sister Millicent than he had ever done before.
Millicent had come up to Oxford as a student at St. Mungo Hall in Dick’s third year. She
had grown into a very efficient and very intelligent young woman. A particularly handsome
young woman as well. She was boyishly slender, and a natural grace kept on breaking
through the somewhat rigid deportment, which she always tried to impose upon herself, in
little beautiful gestures and movements that made the onlooker catch his breath with
astonished pleasure.</p>

<blockquote class="verse">
<p class="i1">“Wincing she was as is a jolly colt,</p>

<p class="i1a">Straight as a mast and upright as a bolt:”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Chaucer had as good an eye for youthful <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-46">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;[Pg
46]</a></span>grace as for mormals and bristly nostrils and thick red jovial
villainousness.</p>

<p>Millicent lost no time in making her presence at St. Mungo’s felt. Second- and
third-year heroines might snort at the forwardness of a mere fresh-girl, might resent the
complete absence of veneration for their glory exhibited by this youthful bejauna;
Millicent pursued her course unmoved. She founded new societies and put fresh life into
the institutions which already existed at St. Mungo’s to take cocoa and discuss the
problems of the universe. She played hockey like a tornado, and she worked alarmingly
hard. Decidedly, Millicent was a Force, very soon the biggest Force in the St. Mungo
world. In her fifth term she organized the famous St. Mungo general strike, which
compelled the authorities to relax a few of the more intolerably tyrannical and
anachronistic rules restricting the liberty of the students. It was she who went, on
behalf of the strikers, to interview the redoubtable Miss Prosser, Principal of St.
Mungo’s. The redoubtable Miss Prosser looked grim and invited her to sit down, Millicent
sat down and, without <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-47">[Pg
47]</a></span>quailing, delivered a short but pointed speech attacking the fundamental
principles of the St. Mungo system of discipline.</p>

<p>“Your whole point of view,” she assured Miss Prosser, “is radically wrong. It’s an
insult to the female sex; it’s positively obscene. Your root assumption is simply this:
that we’re all in a chronic state of sexual excitement; leave us alone for a moment and
we’ll immediately put our desires into practice. It’s disgusting. It makes me blush. After
all, Miss Prosser, we are a college of intelligent women, not an asylum of
nymphomaniacs.”</p>

<p>For the first time in her career, Miss Prosser had to admit herself beaten. The
authorities gave in—reluctantly and on only a few points; but the principle had been
shaken, and that, as Millicent pointed out, was what really mattered.</p>

<p>Dick used to see a good deal of his sister while he was still in residence at
Canteloup, and after he had gone down he used to come regularly once a fortnight during
term to visit her. That horrible mutual reserve, which poisons the social life of most
families and which <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-48">[Pg
48]</a></span>had effectively made of their brotherly and sisterly relation a prolonged
discomfort in the past, began to disappear. They became the best of friends.</p>

<p>“I like you, Dick, a great deal better than I did,” said Millicent one day as they were
parting at the gate of St. Mungo’s after a long walk together.</p>

<p>Dick took off his hat and bowed. “My dear, I reciprocate the sentiment. And, what’s
more, I esteem and admire you. So there.”</p>

<p>Millicent curtsied, and they laughed. They both felt very happy.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h4 id="Farcical_06">VI</h4>

<p class="noindent">“W<small>HAT</small> a life!” said Dick, with a sigh of weariness as
the train moved out of Euston.</p>

<p>Not a bad life, Millicent thought.</p>

<p>“But horribly fatiguing. I am quite outreined by it.”</p>

<p>“Outreined” was Dick’s translation of <i>éreinté</i>. He liked using words of his own
manufacture; one had to learn his idiom before one could properly appreciate his intimate
conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick had every justification for being outreined. The spring and summer had passed for
him in a whirl of incessant activity. He had written three long chapters of the <i>New
Synthetic Philosophy</i>, and had the material for two more ready in the form of notes. He
had helped to organize and bring to its successful conclusion the great carpenters’ strike
of May and June. He had written four pamphlets and a small army of political articles. And
this comprised only half his labour; for nightly, from twelve till two, Pearl Bellairs
emerged to compose the masterpieces which supplied Dick with his bread and butter. <i>Apes
in Purple</i> had been published in May. Since then she had finished <i>La Belle Dame sans
Morality</i>, and had embarked on the first chapters of <i>Daisy’s Voyage to Cythera</i>.
Her weekly articles, “For the Girls of Britain,” had become, during this period, a regular
and favourite feature in the pages of <i>Hildebrand’s Sabbath</i>, that prince of Sunday
papers. At the beginning of July, Dick considered that he had earned a holiday, and now
they were off, he and Millicent, for the North.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick had taken a cottage on the shore of one of those long salt-water lochs that give
to the west coast of Scotland such a dissipated appearance on the map. For miles around
there was not a living soul who did not bear the name of Campbell—two families only
excepted, one of whom was called Murray-Drummond and the other Drummond-Murray. However,
it was not for the people that Dick and Millicent had come, so much as for the landscape,
which made up in variety for anything that the inhabitants might lack. Behind the cottage,
in the midst of a narrow strip of bog lying between the loch and the foot of the
mountains, stood one of the numerous tombs of Ossian, a great barrow of ancient stones.
And a couple of miles away the remains of Deirdre’s Scottish refuge bore witness to the
Celtic past. The countryside was dotted with the black skeletons of mediæval castles.
Astonishing country, convulsed into fantastic mountain shapes, cut and indented by winding
fiords. On summer days the whole of this improbable landscape became blue and remote and
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-51">[Pg 51]</a></span>aerially
transparent. Its beauty lacked all verisimilitude. It was for that reason that Dick chose
the neighbourhood for his holidays. After the insistent actuality of London this frankly
unreal coast was particularly refreshing to a jaded spirit.</p>

<p>“Nous sommes ici en plein romantisme,” said Dick on the day of their arrival, making a
comprehensive gesture towards the dream-like scenery, and for the rest of his holiday he
acted the part of a young romantic of the palmy period. He sat at the foot of Ossian’s
tomb and read Lamartine; he declaimed Byron from the summit of the mountains and Shelley
as he rowed along the loch. In the evening he read George Sand’s <i>Indiana</i>; he
agonized with the pure, but passionate, heroine, while his admiration for Sir Brown, her
English lover, the impassive giant who never speaks and is always clothed in faultless
hunting costume, knew no bounds. He saturated himself in the verses of Victor Hugo, and at
last almost came to persuade himself that the words, <i>Dieu</i>, <i>infinité</i>,
<i>eternité</i>, with which the works of that deplorable genius are so profusely
sprinkled, actually <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-52">[Pg
52]</a></span>possessed some meaning, though what that meaning was he could not, even in
his most romantic transports, discover. Pearl Bellairs, of course, understood quite
clearly their significance, and though she was a very poor French scholar she used
sometimes to be moved almost to tears by the books she found lying about when she came
into existence after midnight. She even copied out extracts into her notebooks with a view
to using them in her next novel.</p>

<blockquote class="verse">
<p class="i0">“Les plus désespérés sont les chants les plus beaux,</p>

<p class="i0a">Et j’en sais d’immortels qui sont de purs sanglots,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">was a couplet which struck her as sublime.</p>

<p>Millicent, meanwhile, did the housekeeping with extraordinary efficiency, took a great
deal of exercise, and read long, serious books; she humoured her brother in his holiday
romanticism, but refused to take part in the game.</p>

<p>The declaration of war took them completely by surprise. It is true that a
<i>Scotsman</i> found its way into the cottage by about lunch-time every day, but it was
never read, and served only to light fires and wrap up fish and things of that <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-53">[Pg 53]</a></span>sort. No letters were
being forwarded, for they had left no address; they were isolated from the world. On the
fatal morning Dick had, indeed, glanced at the paper, without however noticing anything
out of the ordinary. It was only later when, alarmed by the rumours floating round the
village shop, he came to examine his <i>Scotsman</i> more closely, that he found about
half-way down the third column of one of the middle pages an admirable account of all that
had been so tragically happening in the last twenty-four hours; he learnt with horror that
Europe was at war and that; his country too had entered the arena. Even in the midst of
his anguish of spirit he could not help admiring the <i>Scotsman’s</i> splendid
impassivity—no headlines, no ruffling of the traditional aristocratic dignity. Like Sir
Rodolphe Brown in <i>Indiana</i>, he thought, with a sickly smile.</p>

<p>Dick determined to start for London at once. He felt that he must act, or at least
create the illusion of action; he could not stay quietly where he was. It was arranged
that he should set out that afternoon, while Millicent should follow <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-54">[Pg 54]</a></span>a day or two later with
the bulk of the luggage. The train which took him to Glasgow was slower than he thought it
possible for any train to be. He tried to read, he tried to sleep; it was no good. His
nervous agitation was pitiable; he made little involuntary movements with his limbs, and
every now and then the muscles of his face began twitching in a spasmodic and
uncontrollable tic. There were three hours to wait in Glasgow; he spent them in wandering
about the streets. In the interminable summer twilight the inhabitants of Glasgow came
forth into the open to amuse themselves; the sight almost made him sick. Was it possible
that there should be human beings so numerous and so uniformly hideous? Small, deformed,
sallow, they seemed malignantly ugly, as if on purpose. The words they spoke were
incomprehensible. He shuddered; it was an alien place—it was hell.</p>

<p>The London train was crammed. Three gross Italians got into Dick’s carriage, and after
they had drunk and eaten with loud, unpleasant gusto, they prepared themselves for sleep
by taking off their <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-55">[Pg
55]</a></span>boots. Their feet smelt strongly ammoniac, like a cage of mice long
uncleaned. Acutely awake, while the other occupants of the compartment enjoyed a happy
unconsciousness, he looked at the huddled carcasses that surrounded him. The warmth and
the smell of them was suffocating, and there came to his mind, with the nightmarish
insistence of a fixed idea, the thought that every breath they exhaled was saturated with
disease. To be condemned to sit in a hot bath of consumption and syphilis—it was too
horrible! The moment came at last when he could bear it no longer; he got up and went into
the corridor. Standing there, or sitting sometimes for a few dreary minutes in the
lavatory, he passed the rest of the night. The train roared along without a stop. The
roaring became articulate: in the days of his childhood trains used to run to the tune of
“Lancashire, to Lancashire, to fetch a pocket-handkercher; to Lancashire, to Lancashire
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” But to-night the wheels were shouting insistently, a million times over,
two words only—“the War, the War; the War, the War.” He tried <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-56">[Pg 56]</a></span>desperately to make them say something
else, but they refused to recite Milton; they refused to go to Lancashire; they went on
with their endless Tibetan litany—the War, the War, the War.</p>

<p>By the time he reached London, Dick was in a wretched state. His nerves were twittering
and jumping within him; he felt like a walking aviary. The tic in his face had become more
violent and persistent. As he stood in the station, waiting for a cab, he overheard a
small child saying to its mother, “What’s the matter with that man’s face, mother?”</p>

<p>“Sh—sh, darling,” was the reply. “It’s rude.”</p>

<p>Dick turned and saw the child’s big round eyes fixed with fascinated curiosity upon
him, as though he were a kind of monster. He put his hand to his forehead and tried to
stop the twitching of the muscles beneath the skin. It pained him to think that he had
become a scarecrow for children.</p>

<p>Arrived at his flat, Dick drank a glass of brandy and lay down for a rest. He felt
exhausted—ill. At half-past one he got up, drank some more brandy, and crept <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-57">[Pg 57]</a></span>down into the street. It
was intensely hot; the pavements reverberated the sunlight in a glare which hurt his eyes;
they seemed to be in a state of grey incandescence. A nauseating smell of wetted dust rose
from the roadway, along which a water-cart was slowly piddling its way. He realized
suddenly that he ought not to have drunk all that brandy on an empty stomach; he was
definitely rather tipsy. He had arrived at that state of drunkenness when the senses
perceive things clearly, but do not transmit their knowledge to the understanding. He was
painfully conscious of this division, and it needed all the power of his will to establish
contact between his parted faculties. It was as though he were, by a great and prolonged
effort, keeping his brain pressed against the back of his eyes; as soon as he relaxed the
pressure, the understanding part slipped back, the contact was broken, and he relapsed
into a state bordering on imbecility. The actions which ordinarily one does by habit and
without thinking, he had to perform consciously and voluntarily. He had to reason out the
problem of walking—first the left foot <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-58">[Pg 58]</a></span>forward, then the right. How ingeniously he worked his
ankles and knees and hips! How delicately the thighs slid past one another!</p>

<p>He found a restaurant and sat there drinking coffee and trying to eat an omelette until
he felt quite sober. Then he drove to the offices of the <i>Weekly International</i> to
have a talk with Hyman, the editor. Hyman was sitting in his shirt-sleeves, writing.</p>

<p>He lifted his head as Dick came in. “Greenow,” he shouted delightedly, “we were all
wondering what had become of you. We thought you’d joined the Army.”</p>

<p>Dick shook his head, but did not speak; the hot stuffy smell of printer’s ink and
machinery combined with the atrocious reek of Hyman’s Virginian cigarettes to make him
feel rather faint. He sat down on the window-ledge, so as to be able to breathe an
uncontaminated air.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said at last, “what about it?”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be hell.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you suppose I thought it was going to be paradise?” Dick replied irritably.
“Internationalism looks rather funny now, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I believe in it more than ever I did,” cried Hyman. His face lit up with the fervour
of his enthusiasm. It was a fine face, gaunt, furrowed, and angular, for all that he was
barely thirty, looking as though it had been boldly chiselled from some hard stone. “The
rest of the world may go mad; we’ll try and keep our sanity. The time will come when
they’ll see we were right.”</p>

<p>Hyman talked on. His passionate sincerity and singleness of purpose were an inspiration
to Dick. He had always admired Hyman—with the reservations, of course, that the man was
rather a fanatic and not so well-educated as he might have been—but to-day he admired him
more than ever. He was even moved by that perhaps too facile eloquence which of old had
been used to leave him cold. After promising to do a series of articles on international
relations for the paper, Dick went home, feeling better than he had done all day.</p>

<p>He decided that he would begin writing his articles at once. He collected pens, <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-60">[Pg 60]</a></span>paper, and ink and sat
down in a business-like way at his bureau. He remembered distinctly biting the tip of his
pen-holder; it tasted rather bitter.</p>

<p>And then he realized he was standing in Regent Street, looking in at one of the windows
of Liberty’s.</p>

<p>For a long time he stood there quite still, absorbed to all appearance in the
contemplation of a piece of peacock-blue fabric. But all his attention was concentrated
within himself, not on anything outside. He was wondering—wondering how it came about that
he was sitting at his writing-table at one moment, and standing, at the next, in Regent
Street. He hadn’t—the thought flashed upon him—he hadn’t been drinking any more of that
brandy, had he? No, he felt himself to be perfectly sober. He moved slowly away and
continued to speculate as he walked.</p>

<p>At Oxford Circus he bought an evening paper. He almost screamed aloud when he saw that
the date printed at the head of the page was August 12th. It was on August 7th that he had
sat down at his writing-table to compose those articles. <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-61">[Pg 61]</a></span>Five days ago, and he had not the faintest
recollection of what had happened in those five days.</p>

<p>He made all haste back to the flat. Everything was in perfect order. He had evidently
had a picnic lunch that morning—sardines, bread and jam, and raisins; the remains of it
still covered the table. He opened the sideboard and took out the brandy bottle. Better
make quite sure. He held it up to the light; it was more than three-quarters full. Not a
drop had gone since the day of his return. If brandy wasn’t the cause, then what was?</p>

<p>As he sat there thinking, he began in an absent-minded way to look at his evening
paper. He read the news on the front page, then turned to the inner sheets. His eye fell
on these words printed at the head of the column next the leading article:</p>

<p>“To the Women of the Empire. Thoughts in War-Time. By Pearl Bellairs.” Underneath in
brackets: “The first of a series of inspiring patriotic articles by Miss Bellairs, the
well-known novelist.”</p>

<p>Dick groaned in agony. He saw in a <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-62">[Pg 62]</a></span>flash what had happened to his five missing days. Pearl had
got hold of them somehow, had trespassed upon his life out of her own reserved nocturnal
existence. She had taken advantage of his agitated mental state to have a little fun in
her own horrible way.</p>

<p>He picked up the paper once more and began to read Pearl’s article. “Inspiring and
patriotic”: those were feeble words in which to describe Pearl’s shrilly raucous
chauvinism. And the style! Christ! to think that he was responsible, at least in part, for
this. Responsible, for had not the words been written by his own hand and composed in some
horrible bluebeard’s chamber of his own brain? They had, there was no denying it. Pearl’s
literary atrocities had never much distressed him; he had long given up reading a word she
wrote. Her bank balance was the only thing about her that interested him. But now she was
invading the sanctities of his private life. She was trampling on his dearest convictions,
denying his faith. She was a public danger. It was all too frightful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>He passed the afternoon in misery. Suicide or brandy seemed the only cures. Not very
satisfactory ones, though. Towards evening an illuminating idea occurred to him. He would
go and see Rogers. Rogers knew all about psychology—from books, at any rate: Freud, Jung,
Morton Prince, and people like that. He used to try hypnotic experiments on his friends
and even dabbled in amateur psychotherapy. Rogers might help him to lay the ghost of
Pearl. He ate a hasty dinner and went to see Rogers in his Kensington rooms.</p>

<p>Rogers was sitting at a table with a great book open in front of him. The reading-lamp,
which was the only light in the room, brightly illumined one side of the pallid, puffy,
spectacled face, leaving the other in complete darkness, save for a little cedilla of
golden light caught on the fold of flesh at the corner of his mouth. His huge shadow
crossed the floor, began to climb the wall, and from the shoulders upwards mingled itself
with the general darkness of the room.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Rogers,” said Dick <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-64">[Pg 64]</a></span>wearily. “I wish you wouldn’t try and look like Rembrandt’s
‘Christ at Emmaus’ with these spectacular chiaroscuro effects.”</p>

<p>Rogers gave vent to his usual nervous giggling laugh. “This is very nice of you to come
and see me, Greenow.”</p>

<p>“How’s the Board of Trade?” Rogers was a Civil Servant by profession.</p>

<p>“Oh, business as usual, as the <i>Daily Mail</i> would say.” Rogers laughed again as
though he had made a joke.</p>

<p>After a little talk of things indifferent, Dick brought the conversation round to
himself.</p>

<p>“I believe I’m getting a bit neurasthenic,” he said. “Fits of depression, nervous
pains, lassitude, anæmia of the will. I’ve come to you for professional advice. I want you
to nose out my suppressed complexes, analyse me, dissect me. Will you do that for me?”</p>

<p>Rogers was evidently delighted. “I’ll do my best,” he said, with assumed modesty. “But
I’m no good at the thing, so you mustn’t expect much.”</p>

<p>“I’m at your disposal,” said Dick.</p>

<p>Rogers placed his guest in a large arm-chair. <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-65">[Pg 65]</a></span>“Relax your muscles and think of nothing at all.” Dick sat
there flabby and abstracted while Rogers made his preparations. His apparatus consisted
chiefly in a notebook and a stop-watch. He seated himself at the table.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said solemnly, “I want you to listen to me. I propose to read out a list of
words; after each of the words you must say the first word that comes into your head. The
very first, mind, however foolish it may seem. And say it as soon as it crosses your mind;
don’t wait to think. I shall write down your answers and take the time between each
question and reply.”</p>

<p>Rogers cleared his throat and started.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he said in a loud, clear voice. He always began his analyses with the family.
For since the majority of kinks and complexes date from childhood, it is instructive to
investigate the relations between the patient and those who surrounded him at an early
age. “Mother.”</p>

<p>“Dead,” replied Dick immediately. He had scarcely known his mother.</p>

<p>“Father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dull.” One and a fifth seconds’ interval.</p>

<p>“Sister.” Rogers pricked his ears for the reply: his favourite incest-theory depended
on it.</p>

<p>“Fabian Society,” said Dick, after two seconds’ interval. Rogers was a little
disappointed. He was agreeably thrilled and excited by the answer he received to his next
word: “Aunt.”</p>

<p>The seconds passed, bringing nothing with them; and then at last there floated into
Dick’s mind the image of himself as a child, dressed in green velvet and lace, a perfect
Bubbles boy, kneeling on Auntie Loo’s lap and arranging a troop of lead soldiers on the
horizontal projection of her corsage.</p>

<p>“Bosom,” he said.</p>

<p>Rogers wrote down the word and underlined it. Six and three-fifths seconds: very
significant. He turned now to the chapter of possible accidents productive of nervous
shocks.</p>

<p>“Fire.”</p>

<p>“Coal.”</p>

<p>“Sea.”</p>

<p>“Sick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>“Train.”</p>

<p>“Smell.”</p>

<p>And so on. Dull answers all the time. Evidently, nothing very catastrophic had ever
happened to him. Now for a frontal attack on the fortress of sex itself.</p>

<p>“Women.” There was rather a long pause, four seconds, and then Dick replied,
“Novelist.” Rogers was puzzled.</p>

<p>“Breast.”</p>

<p>“Chicken.” That was disappointing. Rogers could find no trace of those sinister moral
censors, expurgators of impulse, suppressors of happiness. Perhaps the trouble lay in
religion.</p>

<p>“Christ,” he said.</p>

<p>Dick replied, “Amen,” with the promptitude of a parish clerk.</p>

<p>“God.”</p>

<p>Dick’s mind remained a perfect blank. The word seemed to convey to him nothing at all.
God, God. After a long time there appeared before his inward eye the face of a boy he had
known at school and at Oxford, one Godfrey Wilkinson, called God for short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wilkinson.” Ten seconds and a fifth.</p>

<p>A few more miscellaneous questions, and the list was exhausted. Almost suddenly, Dick
fell into a kind of hypnotic sleep. Rogers sat pensive in front of his notes; sometimes he
consulted a text-book. At the end of half an hour he awakened Dick to tell him that he had
had, as a child, consciously or unconsciously, a great Freudian passion for his aunt; that
later on he had had another passion, almost religious in its fervour and intensity, for
somebody called Wilkinson; and that the cause of all his present troubles lay in one or
other of these episodes. If he liked, he (Rogers) would investigate the matter further
with a view to establishing a cure.</p>

<p>Dick thanked him very much, thought it wasn’t worth taking any more trouble, and went
home.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h4 id="Farcical_07">VII</h4>

<p class="noindent">M<small>ILLICENT</small> was organizing a hospital supply dépôt,
organizing indefatigably, from morning till night. It was October; Dick had not seen his
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-69">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;[Pg 69]</a></span>sister since those first hours of the war in
Scotland; he had had too much to think about these last months to pay attention to anyone
but himself. To-day, at last, he decided that he would go and pay her a visit. Millicent
had commandeered a large house in Kensington from a family of Jews, who were anxious to
live down a deplorable name by a display of patriotism. Dick found her sitting there in
her office—young, formidable, beautiful, severe—at a big desk covered with papers.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dick, “you’re winning the war, I see.”</p>

<p>“You, I gather, are not,” Millicent replied.</p>

<p>“I believe in the things I always believed in.”</p>

<p>“So do I.”</p>

<p>“But in a different way, my dear—in a different way,” said Dick sadly. There was a
silence.</p>

<p>“Had we better quarrel?” Millicent asked meditatively.</p>

<p>“I think we can manage with nothing worse than a coolness—for the duration.”</p>

<p>“Very well, a coolness.”</p>

<p>“A smouldering coolness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good,” said Millicent briskly. “Let it start smouldering at once. I must get on with
my work. Good-bye, Dick. God bless you. Let me know sometimes how you get on.”</p>

<p>“No need to ask how you get on,” said Dick with a smile, as he shook her hand. “I know
by experience that you always get on, only too well, ruthlessly well.”</p>

<p>He went out. Millicent returned to her letters with concentrated ardour; a frown
puckered the skin between her eyebrows.</p>

<p>Probably, Dick reflected as he made his way down the stairs, he wouldn’t see her again
for a year or so. He couldn’t honestly say that it affected him much. Other people became
daily more and more like ghosts, unreal, thin, vaporous; while every hour the
consciousness of himself grew more intense and all-absorbing. The only person who was more
than a shadow to him now was Hyman of the <i>Weekly International</i>. In those first
horrible months of the war, when he was wrestling with Pearl Bellairs and failing to cast
her out, it was Hyman who kept him from melancholy and suicide. Hyman made him write a
long article every week, <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-71">[Pg
71]</a></span>dragged him into the office to do sub-editorial work, kept him so busy that
there were long hours when he had no time to brood over his own insoluble problems. And
his enthusiasm was so passionate and sincere that sometimes even Dick was infected by it;
he could believe that life was worth living and the cause worth fighting for. But not for
long; for the devil would return, insistent and untiring. Pearl Bellairs was greedy for
life; she was not content with her short midnight hours; she wanted the freedom of whole
days. And whenever Dick was overtired, or ill or nervous, she leapt upon him and stamped
him out of existence, till enough strength came back for him to reassert his personality.
And the articles she wrote! The short stories! The recruiting songs! Dick dared not read
them; they were terrible, terrible.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h4 id="Farcical_08">VIII</h4>

<p class="noindent">THE months passed by. The longer the war lasted, the longer it seemed
likely to last. Dick supported life somehow. Then came the menace of conscription. <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-72">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;[Pg
72]</a></span>The <i>Weekly International</i> organized a great anti-conscription
campaign, in which Hyman and Dick were the leading spirits. Dick was almost happy. This
kind of active work was new to him and he enjoyed it, finding it exciting and at the same
time sedative. For a self-absorbed and brooding mind, pain itself is an anodyne. He
enjoyed his incessant journeys, his speechmaking to queer audiences in obscure halls and
chapels; he liked talking with earnest members of impossible Christian sects, pacifists
who took not the faintest interest in the welfare of humanity at large, but were wholly
absorbed in the salvation of their own souls and in keeping their consciences clear from
the faintest trace of blood-guiltiness. He enjoyed the sense of power which came to him,
when he roused the passion of the crowd to enthusiastic assent, or breasted the storm of
antagonism. He enjoyed everything—even getting a bloody nose from a patriot hired and
intoxicated by a great evening paper to break up one of his meetings. It all seemed
tremendously exciting and important at the time. And yet when, in quiet moments, he came
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-73">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;[Pg 73]</a></span>to look back on his days of activity, they seemed
utterly empty and futile. What was left of them? Nothing, nothing at all. The momentary
intoxication had died away, the stirred ant’s-nest had gone back to normal life. Futility
of action! There was nothing permanent, or decent, or worth while, except thought. And of
that he was almost incapable now. His mind, when it was not occupied by the immediate and
actual, turned inward morbidly upon itself. He looked at the manuscript of his book and
wondered whether he would ever be able to go on with it. It seemed doubtful. Was he, then,
condemned to pass the rest of his existence enslaved to the beastliness and futility of
mere quotidian action? And even in action his powers were limited; if he exerted himself
too much—and the limits of fatigue were soon reached—Pearl Bellairs, watching perpetually
like a hungry tigress for her opportunity, leapt upon him and took possession of his
conscious faculties. And then, it might be for a matter of hours or of days, he was lost,
blotted off the register of living souls, while she performed, with intense and <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-74">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;[Pg
74]</a></span>hideous industry, her self-appointed task. More than once his
anti-conscription campaigns had been cut short and he himself had suddenly disappeared
from public life, to return with the vaguest stories of illness or private affairs—stories
that made his friends shake their heads and wonder which it was among the noble army of
vices that poor Dick Greenow was so mysteriously addicted to. Some said drink, some said
women, some said opium, and some hinted at things infinitely darker and more horrid. Hyman
asked him point-blank what it was, one morning when he had returned to the office after
three days’ unaccountable absence.</p>

<p>Dick blushed painfully. “It isn’t anything you think,” he said.</p>

<p>“What is it, then?” Hyman insisted.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you,” Dick replied desperately and in torture, “but I swear it’s nothing
discreditable. I beg you won’t ask me any more.”</p>

<p>Hyman had to pretend to be satisfied with that.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<h4 id="Farcical_09">IX</h4>

<p class="noindent">A <small>TACTICAL</small> move in the anti-conscription campaign was
the foundation of a club, a place where people with pacific or generally advanced ideas
could congregate.</p>

<p>“A club like this would soon be the intellectual centre of London,” said Hyman, ever
sanguine.</p>

<p>Dick shrugged his shoulders. He had a wide experience of pacifists.</p>

<p>“If you bring people together,” Hyman went on, “they encourage one another to be
bold—strengthen one another’s faith.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dick dyspeptically. “When they’re in a herd, they can believe that they’re
much more numerous and important than they really are.”</p>

<p>“But, man, they are numerous, they are important!” Hyman shouted and gesticulated.</p>

<p>Dick allowed himself to be persuaded into an optimism which he knew to be ill-founded.
The consolations of religion <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-76">[Pg
76]</a></span>do not console the less efficaciously for being illusory.</p>

<p>It was a longtime before they could think of a suitable name for their club. Dick
suggested that it should be called the Sclopis Club. “Such a lovely name,” he explained.
“Sclopis—Sclopis; it tastes precious in the mouth.” But the rest of the committee would
not hear of it; they wanted a name that meant something. One lady suggested that it should
be called the Everyman Club; Dick objected with passion. “It makes one shudder,” he said.
The lady thought it was a beautiful and uplifting name, but as Mr. Greenow was so strongly
opposed, she wouldn’t press the claims of Everyman. Hyman wanted to call it the Pacifist
Club, but that was judged too provocative. Finally, they agreed to call it the Novembrist
Club, because it was November and they could think of no better title.</p>

<p>The inaugural dinner of the Novembrist Club was held at Piccolomini’s Restaurant.
Piccolomini is in, but not exactly of, Soho, for it is a cross between a Soho restaurant
and a Corner House, a hybrid which combines the worst qualities <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-77">[Pg 77]</a></span>of both parents—the dirt and inefficiency
of Soho, the size and vulgarity of Lyons. There is a large upper chamber reserved for
agapes. Here, one wet and dismal winter’s evening, the Novembrists assembled.</p>

<p>Dick arrived early, and from his place near the door he watched his fellow-members come
in. He didn’t much like the look of them. “Middle class” was what he found himself
thinking; and he had to admit, when his conscience reproached him for it, that he did not
like the middle classes, the lower middle classes, the lower classes. He was, there was no
denying it, a bloodsucker at heart—cultured and intelligent, perhaps, but a bloodsucker
none the less.</p>

<p>The meal began. Everything about it was profoundly suspect. The spoons were made of
some pale pinchbeck metal, very light and flimsy; one expected them to melt in the soup,
or one would have done, if the soup had been even tepid. The food was thick and greasy.
Dick wondered what it really looked like under the concealing sauces. The wine left an
indescribable taste that lingered on the palate, <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-78">[Pg 78]</a></span>like the savour of brass or of charcoal fumes.</p>

<p>From childhood upwards Dick had suffered from the intensity of his visceral reactions
to emotion. Fear and shyness were apt to make him feel very sick, and disgust produced in
him a sensation of intolerable queasiness. Disgust had seized upon his mind to-night. He
grew paler with the arrival of every dish, and the wine, instead of cheering him, made him
feel much worse. His neighbours to right and left ate with revolting heartiness. On one
side sat Miss Gibbs, garishly dressed in ill-assorted colours that might be called
futuristic; on the other was Mr. Something in pince-nez, rather ambrosial about the hair.
Mr. Something was a poet, or so the man who introduced them had said. Miss Gibbs was just
an ordinary member of the Intelligentsia, like the rest of us.</p>

<p>The Lower Classes, the Lower Classes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“Are you interested in the Modern Theatre?” asked Mr. Something in his mellow voice.
Too mellow—oh, much too mellow!</p>

<p>“Passably,” said Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>“So am I,” said Mr. Thingummy. “I am a vice-president of the Craftsmen’s League of Joy,
which perhaps you may have heard of.”</p>

<p>Dick shook his head; this was going to be terrible.</p>

<p>“The objects of the Craftsmen’s League of Joy,” Mr. Thingummy continued, “or rather,
one of the objects—for it has many—is to establish Little Theatres in every town and
village in England, where simple, uplifting, beautiful plays might be acted. The people
have no joy.”</p>

<p>“They have the cinema and the music hall,” said Dick. He was filled with a sudden
senseless irritation. “They get all the joy they want out of the jokes of the comics and
the legs of the women.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but that is an impure joy,” Mr. What’s-his-name protested.</p>

<p>“Impure purple, Herbert Spenser’s favourite colour,” flashed irrelevantly through
Dick’s brain.</p>

<p>“Well, speaking for myself,” he said aloud, “I know I get more joy out of a good pair
of legs than out of any number of uplifting plays of the kind they’d be <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-80">[Pg 80]</a></span>sure to act in your
little theatres. The people ask for sex and you give them a stone.”</p>

<p>How was it, he wondered, that the right opinions in the mouths of these people sounded
so horribly cheap and wrong? They degraded what was noble; beauty became fly-blown at
their touch. Their intellectual tradition was all wrong. Lower classes, it always came
back to that. When they talked about war and the International, Dick felt a hot geyser of
chauvinism bubbling up in his breast. In order to say nothing stupid, he refrained from
speaking at all. Miss Gibbs switched the conversation on to art. She admired all the right
people. Dick told her that he thought Sir Luke Fildes to be the best modern artist. But
his irritation knew no bounds when he found out a little later that Mr. Something had read
the poems of Fulke Greville, Lord Brooke. He felt inclined to say, “You may have read
them, but of course you can’t understand or appreciate them.”</p>

<p>Lower Classes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>How clear and splendid were the ideas of right and justice! If only one <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-81">[Pg 81]</a></span>could filter away the
contaminating human element. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Reason compelled him to believe in democracy,
in internationalism, in revolution; morality demanded justice for the oppressed. But
neither morality nor reason would ever bring him to take pleasure in the company of
democrats or revolutionaries, or make him find the oppressed, individually, any less
antipathetic.</p>

<p>At the end of this nauseating meal, Dick was called on to make a speech. Rising to his
feet, he began stammering and hesitating; he felt like an imbecile. Then suddenly
inspiration came. The great religious ideas of Justice and Democracy swept like a rushing
wind through his mind, purging it of all insignificant human and personal preferences or
dislikes. He was filled with pentecostal fire. He spoke in a white heat of intellectual
passion, dominating his hearers, infecting them with his own high enthusiasm. He sat down
amid cheers. Miss Gibbs and Mr. Thingummy leaned towards him with flushed, shining
faces.</p>

<p>“That was wonderful, Mr. Greenow. I’ve never heard anything like it,” <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-82">[Pg 82]</a></span>exclaimed Miss Gibbs,
with genuine, unflattering enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Mr. Thing said something poetical about a trumpet-call. Dick looked from one to the
other with blank and fishy eyes. So it was for these creatures he had been speaking!</p>

<p>Good God! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h4 id="Farcical_10">X</h4>

<p class="noindent">D<small>ICK</small>’<small>S</small> life was now a monotonous
nightmare. The same impossible situation was repeated again and again. If it were not for
the fact that he knew Pearl Bellairs to be entirely devoid of humour, Dick might have
suspected that she was having a little quiet fun with him, so grotesque were the anomalies
of his double life. Grotesque, but dreary, intolerably dreary. Situations which seem, in
contemplation, romantic and adventurous have a habit of proving, when actually
experienced, as dull and daily as a bank clerk’s routine. When you read about it, a Jekyll
and Hyde existence sounds delightfully amusing; but when you live through it, as Dick
found to his cost, it is merely a boring horror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>In due course Dick was called up by the Military Authorities. He pleaded conscientious
objection. The date of his appearance before the Tribunal was fixed. Dick did not much
relish the prospect of being a Christian martyr; it seemed an anachronism. However, it
would have to be done. He would be an absolutist; there would be a little buffeting,
spitting, and scourging, followed by an indefinite term of hard labour. It was all very
unpleasant. But nothing could be much more unpleasant than life as he was now living it.
He didn’t even mind very much if they killed him. Being or not being—the alternatives left
him equally cold.</p>

<p>The days that preceded his appearance before the Tribunal were busy days, spent in
consulting solicitors, preparing speeches, collecting witnesses.</p>

<p>“We’ll give you a good run for your money,” said Hyman. “I hope they’ll be feeling a
little uncomfortable by the time they have done with you, Greenow.”</p>

<p>“Not nearly so uncomfortable as I <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-84">[Pg 84]</a></span>shall be feeling,” Dick replied, with a slightly melancholy
smile.</p>

<p>The South Marylebone Tribunal sat in a gloomy and fetid chamber in a police station.
Dick, who was extremely sensitive to his surroundings, felt his fatigue and nervousness
perceptibly increase as he entered the room. Five or six pitiable creatures with paralytic
mothers or one-man businesses were briskly disposed of, and then it was Dick’s turn to
present himself before his judges. He looked round the court, nodded to Hyman, smiled at
Millicent, who had so far thawed their wartime coolness as to come and see him condemned,
caught other friendly eyes. It was as though he were about to be electrocuted. The
preliminaries passed off; he found himself answering questions in a loud, clear voice.
Then the Military Representative began to loom horribly large. The Military Representative
was a solicitor’s clerk disguised as a lieutenant in the Army Service Corps. He spoke in
an accent that was more than genteel; it was rich, noble, aristocratic. Dick tried to
remember where he had heard a <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-85">[Pg
85]</a></span>man speaking like that before. He had it now. Once when he had been at
Oxford after term was over. He had gone to see the Varieties, which come twice nightly and
with cheap seats to the theatre after the undergraduates have departed. One of the turns
had been a Nut, a descendant of the bloods and Champagne Charlies of earlier days. A young
man in an alpaca evening suit and a monocle. He had danced, sung a song, spoken some
patter. Sitting in the front row of the stalls, Dick had been able to see the large,
swollen, tuberculous glands in his neck. They wobbled when he danced or sang.
Fascinatingly horrible, those glands; and the young man, how terribly, painfully pathetic.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When the Military Representative spoke, he could hear again that wretched
Nut’s rendering of the Eton and Oxford voice. It unnerved him.</p>

<p>“What is your religion, Mr. Greenow?” the Military Representative asked.</p>

<p>Fascinated, Dick looked to see whether he too had tuberculous glands. The Lieutenant
had to repeat his question <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-86">[Pg
86]</a></span>sharply. When he was irritated, his voice went back to its more natural
nasal twang. Dick recovered his presence of mind.</p>

<p>“I have no religion,” he answered.</p>

<p>“But, surely, sir, you must have some kind of religion.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I must, if it’s in the Army Regulations, you had better put me down as an
Albigensian, or a Bogomile, or, better still, as a Manichean. One can’t find oneself in
this court without possessing a profound sense of the reality and active existence of a
power of evil equal to, if not greater than, the power of good.”</p>

<p>“This is rather irrelevant, Mr. Greenow,” said the Chairman.</p>

<p>“I apologize.” Dick bowed to the court.</p>

<p>“But if,” the Military Representative continued—“if your objection is not religious,
may I ask what it is?”</p>

<p>“It is based on a belief that all war is wrong, and that the solidarity of the human
race can only be achieved in practice by protesting against war, wherever it appears and
in whatever form.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you disbelieve in force, Mr. Greenow?”</p>

<p>“You might as well ask me if I disbelieve in gravitation. Of course, I believe in
force: it is a fact.”</p>

<p>“What would you do if you saw a German violating your sister?” said the Military
Representative, putting his deadliest question.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I had better ask my sister first,” Dick replied. “She is sitting just behind
you in the court.”</p>

<p>The Military Representative was covered with confusion. He coughed and blew his nose.
The case dragged on. Dick made a speech; the Military Representative made a speech; the
Chairman made a speech. The atmosphere of the court-room grew fouler and fouler. Dick
sickened and suffocated in the second-hand air. An immense lassitude took possession of
him; he did not care about anything—about the cause, about himself, about Hyman or
Millicent or Pearl Bellairs. He was just tired. Voices buzzed and drawled in his
ears—sometimes his own voice, sometimes other people’s. He did not listen to <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-88">[Pg 88]</a></span>what they said. He was
tired—tired of all this idiotic talk, tired of the heat and smell. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tired of picking up very thistly wheat sheaves and propping them up in stooks on the
yellow stubble. For that was what, suddenly, he found himself doing. Overhead the sky
expanded in endless steppes of blue-hot cobalt. The pungent prickly dust of the dried
sheaves plucked at his nose with imminent sneezes, made his eyes smart and water. In the
distance a reaping-machine whirred and hummed. Dick looked blankly about him, wondering
where he was. He was thankful, at any rate, not to be in that sweltering court-room; and
it was a mercy, too, to have escaped from the odious gentility of the Military
Representative’s accent. And, after all, there were worse occupations than harvesting.</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gradually, and bit by bit, Dick pieced together his history. He had, it seemed, done a
cowardly and treacherous thing: deserted in the face of the enemy, betrayed his cause. He
had a bitter letter <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-89">[Pg
89]</a></span>from Hyman. “Why couldn’t you have stuck it out? I thought it was in you.
You’ve urged others to go to prison for their beliefs, but you get out of it yourself by
sneaking off to a soft alternative service job on a friend’s estate. You’ve brought
discredit on the whole movement.” It was very painful, but what could he answer? The truth
was so ridiculous that nobody could be expected to swallow it. And yet the fact was that
he had been as much startled to find himself working at Crome as anyone. It was all
Pearl’s doing.</p>

<p>He had found in his room a piece of paper covered with the large, flamboyant feminine
writing which he knew to be Pearl’s. It was evidently the rough copy of an article on the
delights of being a land-girl: dewy dawns, rosy children’s faces, quaint cottages, mossy
thatch, milkmaids, healthy exercise. Pearl was being a land-girl; but he could hardly
explain the fact to Hyman. Better not attempt to answer him.</p>

<p>Dick hated the manual labour of the farm. It was hard, monotonous, dirty, and
depressing. It inhibited almost completely <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-90">[Pg 90]</a></span>the functions of his brain. He was unable to think about
anything at all; there was no opportunity to do anything but feel uncomfortable. God had
not made him a Caliban to scatter ordure over fields, to pick up ordure from cattle-yards.
His rôle was Prospero.</p>

<p>“Ban, Ban, Caliban”—it was to that derisive measure that he pumped water, sawed wood,
mowed grass; it was a march for his slow, clotted feet as he followed the dung-carts up
the winding lanes. “Ban, Ban, Caliban—Ban, Ban, Ban .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that bloody old fool Tolstoy,” was his profoundest reflection on a general subject
in three months of manual labour and communion with mother earth.</p>

<p>He hated the work, and his fellow-workers hated him. They mistrusted him because they
could not understand him, taking the silence of his overpowering shyness for arrogance and
the contempt of one class for another. Dick longed to become friendly with them. His chief
trouble was that he did not know what to say. At meal-times he would spend long minutes in
cudgelling his brains for some suitable remark to make. And even if <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-91">[Pg 91]</a></span>he thought of something
good, like—“It looks as though it were going to be a good year for roots,” he somehow
hesitated to speak, feeling that such a remark, uttered in his exquisitely modulated
tones, would be, somehow, a little ridiculous. It was the sort of thing that ought to be
said rustically, with plenty of Z’s and long vowels, in the manner of William Barnes. In
the end, for lack of courage to act the yokel’s part, he generally remained silent. While
the others were eating their bread and cheese with laughter and talk, he sat like the
skeleton at the feast—a skeleton that longed to join in the revelry, but had not the power
to move its stony jaws. On the rare occasions that he actually succeeded in uttering
something, the labourers looked at one another in surprise and alarm, as though it were
indeed a skeleton that had spoken.</p>

<p>He was not much more popular with the other inhabitants of the village. Often, in the
evenings, as he was returning from work, the children would pursue him, yelling. With the
unerringly cruel instinct of the young they had recognized in him a fit object for abuse
and lapidation. <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-92">[Pg 92]</a></span>An
outcast member of another class, from whom that class in casting him out had withdrawn its
protection, an alien in speech and habit, a criminal, as their zealous schoolmaster lost
no opportunity of reminding them, guilty of the blackest treason against God and man—he
was the obviously predestined victim of childish persecution. When stones began to fly,
and dung and precocious obscenity, he bowed his head and pretended not to notice that
anything unusual was happening. It was difficult, however, to look quite dignified.</p>

<p>There were occasional short alleviations to the dreariness of his existence. One day,
when he was engaged in his usual occupation of manuring, a familiar figure suddenly
appeared along the footpath through the field. It was Mrs. Cravister. She was evidently
staying at the big house; one of the Manorial dachshunds preceded her. He took off his
cap.</p>

<p>“Mr. Greenow!” she exclaimed, coming to a halt. “Ah, what a pleasure to see you again!
Working on the land: so Tolstoyan. But I trust it doesn’t affect your æsthetic ideas in
the same way <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-93">[Pg 93]</a></span>as it
did his. Fifty peasants singing together is music; but Bach’s chromatic fantasia is mere
gibbering incomprehensibility.”</p>

<p>“I don’t do this for pleasure,” Dick explained. “It’s hard labour, meted out to the
Conscientious Objector.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” said Mrs. Cravister, raising her hand to arrest any further
explanation. “I had forgotten. A conscientious objector, a Bible student. I remember how
passionately devoted you were, even at school, to the Bible.”</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and nodded her head several times.</p>

<p>“On the contrary——” Dick began; but it was no good. Mrs. Cravister had determined that
he should be a Bible student and it was no use gainsaying her. She cut him short.</p>

<p>“Dear me, the Bible. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What a style! That alone would prove it to have
been directly inspired. You remember how Mahomet appealed to the beauty of his style as a
sign of his divine mission. Why has nobody done the same for the Bible? It remains for
you, Mr. Greenow, to do so. You will <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-94">[Pg 94]</a></span>write a book about it. How I envy you!”</p>

<p>“The style is very fine,” Dick ventured, “but don’t you think the matter occasionally
leaves something to be desired?”</p>

<p>“The matter is nothing,” cried Mrs. Cravister, making a gesture that seemed to send all
meaning flying like a pinch of salt along the wind—“nothing at all. It’s the style that
counts. Think of Madame Bovary.”</p>

<p>“I certainly will,” said Dick.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cravister held out her hand. “Good-bye. Yes, I certainly envy you. I envy you your
innocent labour and your incessant study of that most wonderful of books. If I were asked,
Mr. Greenow, what book I should take with me to a desert island, what single solitary
book, I should certainly say the Bible, though, indeed, there are moments when I think I
should choose <i>Tristram Shandy</i>. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Cravister sailed slowly away. The little brown basset trotted ahead, straining his
leash. One had the impression of a great ship being towed into harbour by a diminutive
tug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick was cheered by this glimpse of civilization and humanity. The unexpected arrival,
one Saturday afternoon, of Millicent was not quite such an unmixed pleasure. “I’ve come to
see how you’re getting on,” she announced, “and to put your cottage straight and make you
comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Very kind of you,” said Dick. He didn’t want his cottage put straight.</p>

<p>Millicent was in the Ministry of Munitions now, controlling three thousand female
clerks with unsurpassed efficiency. Dick looked at her curiously, as she talked that
evening of her doings. “To think I should have a sister like that,” he said to himself.
She was terrifying.</p>

<p>“You do enjoy bullying other people!” he exclaimed at last. “You’ve found your true
vocation. One sees now how the new world will be arranged after the war. The women will
continue to do all the bureaucratic jobs, all that entails routine and neatness and
interfering with other people’s affairs. And man, it is to be hoped, will be left free for
the important statesman’s business, <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-96">[Pg 96]</a></span>free for creation and thought. He will stay at home and
give proper education to the children, too. He is fit to do these things, because his mind
is disinterested and detached. It’s an arrangement which will liberate all man’s best
energies for their proper uses. The only flaw I can see in the system is that you women
will be so fiendishly and ruthlessly tyrannical in your administration.”</p>

<p>“You can’t seriously expect me to argue with you,” said Millicent.</p>

<p>“No, please don’t. I am not strong enough. My dung-carrying has taken the edge off all
my reasoning powers.”</p>

<p>Millicent spent the next morning in completely rearranging Dick’s furniture. By
lunch-time every article in the cottage was occupying a new position.</p>

<p>“That’s much nicer,” said Millicent, surveying her work and seeing that it was
good.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. Dick opened it and was astonished to find Hyman.</p>

<p>“I just ran down to see how you were getting on,” he explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m getting on very well since my sister rearranged my furniture,” said Dick. He found
it pleasing to have an opportunity of exercising his long unused powers of malicious
irony. This was very mild, but with practice he would soon come on to something more
spiteful and amusing.</p>

<p>Hyman shook hands with Millicent, scowling as he did so. He was irritated that she was
there; he wanted to talk with Dick alone. He turned his back on her and began addressing
Dick.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I haven’t seen you since the fatal day. How is the
turnip-hoeing?”</p>

<p>“Pretty beastly,” said Dick.</p>

<p>“Better than doing hard labour in a gaol, I suppose?”</p>

<p>Dick nodded his head wearily, foreseeing what must inevitably come.</p>

<p>“You’ve escaped that all right,” Hyman went on.</p>

<p>“Yes; you ought to be thankful,” Millicent chimed in.</p>

<p>“I still can’t understand why you did it, Greenow. It was a blow to me. I didn’t expect
it of you.” Hyman <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-98">[Pg
98]</a></span>spoke with feeling. “It was desertion; it was treason.”</p>

<p>“I agree,” said Millicent judicially. “He ought to have stuck to his principles.”</p>

<p>“He ought to have stuck to what was right, oughtn’t he, Miss Greenow?” Hyman turned
towards Millicent, pleased at finding someone who shared his views.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she replied—“of course. I totally disagree with you about what is right.
But if he believed it right not to fight, he certainly ought to have gone to prison for
his belief.”</p>

<p>Dick lit a pipe with an air of nonchalance. He tried to disguise the fact that he was
feeling extremely uncomfortable under these two pairs of merciless, accusing eyes.</p>

<p>“To my mind, at any rate,” said Millicent, “your position seems quite illogical and
untenable, Dick.”</p>

<p>It was a relief to be talked to and not about.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry about that,” said Dick rather huskily—not a very intelligent remark, but
what was there to say?</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s illogical and untenable. <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-99">[Pg 99]</a></span>Your sister is quite right.” Hyman banged the table.</p>

<p>“I can’t understand what induced you to take it up——”</p>

<p>“After you’d said you were going to be one of the absolutes,” cried Hyman, interrupting
and continuing Millicent’s words.</p>

<p>“Why?” said Millicent.</p>

<p>“Why, why, why?” Hyman echoed.</p>

<p>Dick, who had been blowing out smoke at a great rate, put down his pipe. The taste of
the tobacco was making him feel rather sick. “I wish you would stop,” he said wearily. “If
I gave you the real reasons, you wouldn’t believe me. And I can’t invent any others that
would be in the least convincing.”</p>

<p>“I believe the real reason is that you were afraid of prison.”</p>

<p>Dick leaned back in his chair and shut his eyes. He did not mind being insulted now; it
made no difference. Hyman and Millicent were still talking about him, but what they said
did not interest him; he scarcely listened.</p>

<p>They went back to London together in the evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very intelligent woman, your sister,” said Hyman just before they were starting. “Pity
she’s not on the right side about the war and so forth.”</p>

<p>Four weeks later Dick received a letter in which Hyman announced that he and Millicent
had decided to get married.</p>

<p>“I am happy to think,” Dick wrote in his congratulatory reply, “that it was I who
brought you together.”</p>

<p>He smiled as he read through the sentence; that was what the Christian martyr might say
to the two lions who had scraped acquaintance over his bones in the amphitheatre.</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>One warm afternoon in the summer of 1918, Mr. Hobart, Clerk to the Wibley Town Council,
was disturbed in the midst of his duties by the sudden entry into his office of a small
dark man, dressed in corduroys and gaiters, but not having the air of a genuine
agricultural labourer.</p>

<p>“What may I do for you?” inquired Mr. Hobart.</p>

<p>“I have come to inquire about my vote,” said the stranger.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you already registered?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not yet. You see, it isn’t long since the Act was passed giving us the vote.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hobart stared.</p>

<p>“I don’t quite follow,” he said.</p>

<p>“I may not look it,” said the stranger, putting his head on one side and looking
arch—“I may not look it, but I will confess to you, Mr.—er—Mr.—er——”</p>

<p>“Hobart.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hobart, that I am a woman of over thirty.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hobart grew visibly paler. Then, assuming a forced smile and speaking as one speaks
to a child or a spoiled animal, he said:</p>

<p>“I see—I see. Over thirty, dear me.”</p>

<p>He looked at the bell, which was over by the fireplace at the other side of the room,
and wondered how he should ring it without rousing the maniac’s suspicions.</p>

<p>“Over thirty,” the stranger went on. “You know my woman’s secret. I am Miss Pearl
Bellairs, the novelist. Perhaps you have read some of my books. Or are you too busy?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, I’ve read several,” Mr. Hobart replied, smiling more and more <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-102">[Pg 102]</a></span>brightly and speaking
in even more coaxing and indulgent tones.</p>

<p>“Then we’re friends already, Mr. Hobart. Anyone who knows my books, knows me. My whole
heart is in them. Now, you must tell me all about my poor little vote. I shall be very
patriotic with it when the time comes to use it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hobart saw his opportunity.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Miss Bellairs,” he said. “I will ring for my clerk and we’ll—er—we’ll take
down the details.”</p>

<p>He got up, crossed the room, and rang the bell with violence.</p>

<p>“I’ll just go and see that he brings the right books,” he added, and darted to the
door. Once outside in the passage, he mopped his face and heaved a sigh of relief. That
had been a narrow shave, by Jove. A loony in the office—dangerous-looking brute, too.</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the following day Dick woke up and found himself in a bare whitewashed room,
sparsely furnished with a little iron bed, a washstand, a chair, and table. He looked
round him in surprise. Where had he got to this time? He went to the <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-103">[Pg 103]</a></span>door and tried to open
it; it was locked. An idea entered his mind: he was in barracks somewhere; the Military
Authorities must have got hold of him somehow in spite of his exemption certificate. Or
perhaps Pearl had gone and enlisted. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He turned next to the window, which
was barred. Outside, he could see a courtyard, filled, not with soldiers, as he had
expected, but a curious motley crew of individuals, some men and some women, wandering
hither and thither with an air of complete aimlessness. Very odd, he thought—very odd.
Beyond the courtyard, on the farther side of a phenomenally high wall, ran a railway line
and beyond it a village, roofed with tile and thatch, and a tall church spire in the
midst. Dick looked carefully at the spire. Didn’t he know it? Surely—yes, those imbricated
copper plates with which it was covered, that gilded ship that served as wind vane, the
little gargoyles at the corner of the tower there could be no doubt; it was Belbury
church. Belbury—that was where the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, no; he wouldn’t believe it. But
looking down again into that high-walled courtyard, <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-104">[Pg 104]</a></span>full of those queer, aimless folk, he was
forced to admit it. The County Asylum stands at Belbury. He had often noticed it from the
train, a huge, gaunt building of sausage-coloured brick, standing close to the railway, on
the opposite side of the line to Belbury village and church. He remembered how, the last
time he had passed in the train, he had wondered what they did in the asylum. He had
regarded it then as one of those mysterious, unapproachable places, like Lhassa or a
Ladies’ Lavatory, into which he would never penetrate. And now, here he was, looking out
through the bars, like any other madman. It was all Pearl’s doing, as usual. If there had
been no bars, he would have thrown himself out of the window.</p>

<p>He sat down on his bed and began to think about what he should do. He would have to be
very sane and show them by his behaviour and speech that he was no more mad than the
commonalty of mankind. He would be extremely dignified about it all. If a warder or a
doctor or somebody came in to see him, he would rise to his feet and say in <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-105">[Pg 105]</a></span>the calmest and
severest tones: “May I ask, pray, why I am detained here and upon whose authority?” That
ought to stagger them. He practised that sentence, and the noble attitude with which he
would accompany it, for the best part of an hour. Then, suddenly, there was the sound of a
key in the lock. He hastily sat down again on the bed. A brisk little man of about forty,
clean shaven and with pince-nez, stepped into the room, followed by a nurse and a warder
in uniform. The doctor! Dick’s heart was beating with absurd violence; he felt like an
amateur actor at the first performance of an imperfectly rehearsed play. He rose, rather
unsteadily, to his feet, and in a voice that quavered a little with an emotion he could
not suppress, began:</p>

<p>“Pray I ask, may .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Then, realizing that something had gone wrong, he hesitated, stammered, and came to a
pause.</p>

<p>The doctor turned to the nurse.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” he asked. “He called me May. He seems to think everybody’s a
woman, not only himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning to Dick with a cheerful smile, he went on:</p>

<p>“Sit down, Miss Bellairs, please sit down.”</p>

<p>It was too much. Dick burst into tears, flung himself upon the bed, and buried his face
in the pillow. The doctor looked at him as he lay there sobbing, his whole body shaken and
convulsed.</p>

<p>“A bad case, I fear.”</p>

<p>And the nurse nodded.</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the next three days Dick refused to eat. It was certainly unreasonable, but it
seemed the only way of making a protest. On the fourth day the doctor signed a certificate
to the effect that forcible feeding had become necessary. Accompanied by two warders and a
nurse, he entered Dick’s room.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Bellairs,” he said, making a last persuasive appeal, “do have a little of
this nice soup. We have come to have lunch with you.”</p>

<p>“I refuse to eat,” said Dick icily, “as a protest against my unlawful detention in this
place. I am as sane as any of you here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes.” The doctor’s voice was soothing. He made a sign to the warders. One was
very large and stout, the other wiry, thin, sinister, like the second murderer in a play.
They closed in on Dick.</p>

<p>“I won’t eat and I won’t be made to eat!” Dick cried. “Let me go!” he shouted at the
fat warder, who had laid a hand on his shoulder. His temper was beginning to rise.</p>

<p>“Now, do behave yourself,” said the fat warder. “It ain’t a bit of use kicking up a
row. Now, do take a little of this lovely soup,” he added wheedlingly.</p>

<p>“Let me go!” Dick screamed again, all his self-control gone. “I will not let myself be
bullied.”</p>

<p>He began to struggle violently. The fat warder put an arm round his shoulders, as
though he were an immense mother comforting an irritable child. Dick felt himself
helpless; the struggle had quite exhausted him; he was weaker than he had any idea of. He
began kicking the fat man’s shins; it was the only way he could still show fight.</p>

<p>“Temper, temper,” remonstrated the <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-108">[Pg 108]</a></span>warder, more motherly than ever. The thin warder stooped
down, slipped a strap round the kicking legs, and drew it tight. Dick could move no more.
His fury found vent in words—vain, abusive, filthy words, such as he had not used since he
was a schoolboy.</p>

<p>“Let me go,” he screamed—“let me go, you devils! You beasts, you swine! beasts and
swine!” he howled again and again.</p>

<p>They soon had him securely strapped in a chair, his head held back ready for the doctor
and his horrible-looking tubes. They were pushing the horrors up his nostrils. He coughed
and choked, spat, shouted inarticulately, retched. It was like having a spoon put on your
tongue and being told to say A-a-h, but worse; it was like jumping into the river and
getting water up your nose—how he had always hated that!—only much worse. It was like
almost everything unpleasant, only much, much worse than all. He exhausted himself
struggling against his utterly immovable bonds. They had to carry him to his bed, he was
so weak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>He lay there, unmoving—for he was unable to move—staring at the ceiling. He felt as
though he were floating on air, unsupported, solid no longer; the sensation was not
unpleasant. For that reason he refused to let his mind dwell upon it; he would think of
nothing that was not painful, odious, horrible. He thought about the torture which had
just been inflicted on him and of the monstrous injustice of which he was a victim. He
thought of the millions who had been and were still being slaughtered in the war; he
thought of their pain, all the countless separate pains of them; pain incommunicable,
individual, beyond the reach of sympathy; infinities of pain pent within frail finite
bodies; pain without sense or object, bringing with it no hope and no redemption, futile,
unnecessary, stupid. In one supreme apocalyptic moment he saw, he felt the universe in all
its horror.</p>

<p>They forcibly fed him again the following morning and again on the day after. On the
fourth day pneumonia, the result of shock, complicated by <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-110">[Pg 110]</a></span>acute inflammation of the throat and
pleura, set in. The fever and pain gained ground. Dick had not the strength to resist
their ravages, and his condition grew hourly worse. His mind, however, continued to work
clearly—too clearly. It occurred to him that he might very likely die. He asked for pencil
and paper to be brought him, and putting forth all the little strength he had left, he
began to make his testament.</p>

<p>“I am perfectly sane,” he wrote at the top of the page, and underlined the words three
times. “I am confined here by the most intol. injust.” As soon as he began, he realized
how little time and strength were left him; it was a waste to finish the long words. “They
are killing me for my opins. I regard this war and all wars as utter bad. Capitalists’
war. The devils will be smashed sooner later. Wish I could help. But it won’t make any
difference,” he added on a new line and as though by an afterthought. “World will always
be hell. Cap. or Lab., Engl. or Germ.—all beasts. One in a mill. is G<small>OOD</small>.
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-111">[Pg 111]</a></span>I wasn’t.
Selfish intellect. Perhaps Pearl Bellairs better. If die, send corp. to hosp. for anatomy.
Useful for once in my life!”</p>

<p>Quite suddenly, he lapsed into delirium. The clear lucidity of his mind became
troubled. The real world disappeared from before his eyes, and in its place he saw a
succession of bright, unsteady visions created by his sick fantasy. Scenes from his
childhood, long forgotten, bubbled up and disappeared. Unknown, hideous faces crowded in
upon him; old friends revisited him. He was living in a bewildering mixture of the
familiar and the strange. And all the while, across this changing unsubstantial world,
there hurried a continual, interminable procession of dromedaries—countless high-domed
beasts, with gargoyle faces and stiff legs and necks that bobbed as though on springs. Do
what he could, he was unable to drive them away. He lost his temper with the brutes at
last, struck at them, shouted; but in vain. The room rang with his cries of, “Get away,
you beasts. Bloody humps. None of your nonconformist faces here.” And while <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-112">[Pg 112]</a></span>he was yelling and
gesticulating (with his left hand only), his right hand was still busily engaged in
writing. The words were clear and legible; the sentences consecutive and eminently sane.
Dick might rave, but Pearl Bellairs remained calm and in full possession of her deplorable
faculties. And what was Pearl doing with her busy pencil, while Dick, like a frenzied
Betsy Trotwood, shouted at the trespassing camels? The first thing she did was to scratch
out all that poor Dick had said about the war. Underneath it she wrote:</p>

<p>“We shall not sheathe the sword, which we have not lightly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” And then,
evidently finding that memorable sentence too long, particularly so since the addition of
Poland and Czecho-Slovakia to the list of Allies, she began again.</p>

<p>“We are fighting for honour and the defence of Small Nationalities. Plucky little
Belgium! We went into the war with clean hands.”</p>

<p>A little of Pearl’s thought seemed at this moment to have slopped over into Dick’s
mind; for he suddenly stopped abusing his dromedaries and began to cry <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-113">[Pg 113]</a></span>out in the most
pitiable fashion, “Clean hands, clean hands! I can’t get mine clean. I can’t, I can’t, I
can’t. I contaminate everything.” And he kept rubbing his left hand against the
bed-clothes and putting his fingers to his nose, only to exclaim, “Ugh, they still stink
of goat!” and then to start rubbing again.</p>

<p>The right hand wrote on unperturbed. “No peace with the Hun until he is crushed and
humiliated. Self-respecting Britons will refuse to shake a Hunnish hand for many a long
year after the war. No more German waiters. Intern the Forty-Seven Thousand Hidden Hands
in High Places!”</p>

<p>At this point, Pearl seemed to have been struck by a new idea. She took a clean page
and began:</p>

<p>“To the Girls of England. I am a woman and proud of the fact. But, girls, I blushed for
my sex to-day when I read in the papers that there had been cases of English girls talking
to Hun prisoners, and not only talking to them, but allowing themselves to be kissed by
them. Imagine! Clean, healthy British girls allowing themselves to be kissed by the
swinish and <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-114">[Pg
114]</a></span>bloodstained lips of the unspeakable Hun! Do you wonder that I blush for my
sex? Stands England where she did? No, emphatically no, if these stories are true, and
true—sadly and with a heavy bleeding heart do I admit it—true they are.”</p>

<p>“Clean hands, clean hands,” Dick was still muttering, and applying his ringers to his
nose once more, “Christ,” he cried, “how they stink! Goats, dung .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“Is there any excuse for such conduct?” the pencil continued. “The most that can be
said in palliation of the offence is that girls are thoughtless, that they do not consider
the full significance of their actions. But listen to me, girls of all ages, classes and
creeds, from the blue-eyed, light-hearted flapper of sixteen to the stern-faced,
hard-headed business woman—listen to me. There is a girlish charm about thoughtlessness,
but there is a point beyond which thoughtlessness becomes criminal. A flapper may kiss a
Hun without thinking what she is doing, merely for the fun of the thing; perhaps, even,
out of misguided pity. Will she repeat the offence if she realizes, as she <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-115">[Pg 115]</a></span>must realize if she
will only think, that this thoughtless fun, this mawkish and hysterical pity, is nothing
less than Treason? Treason—it is a sinister word, but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>The pencil stopped writing; even Pearl was beginning to grow tired. Dick’s shouting had
died away to a hoarse, faint whisper. Suddenly her attention was caught by the last words
that Dick had written—the injunction to send his body, if he died, to a hospital for an
anatomy. She put forth a great effort.</p>

<p>“NO. NO,” she wrote in huge capitals. “Bury me in a little country churchyard, with
lovely marble angels like the ones in St. George’s at Windsor, over Princess Charlotte’s
tomb. Not anatomy. Too horrible, too disgus .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>The coma which had blotted out Dick’s mind fell now upon hers as well. Two hours later
Dick Greenow was dead; the fingers of his right hand still grasped a pencil. The scribbled
papers were thrown away as being merely the written ravings of a madman; they were
accustomed that sort of thing at the asylum.</p>

<h3 id="Happily"><a href="#Happily_toc">HAPPILY EVER AFTER</a></h3>

<h4 class="first" id="Happily_01">I</h4>

<p class="noindent">A<small>T</small> the best of times it is a long way from Chicago to
Blaybury in Wiltshire, but war has fixed between them a great gulf. In the circumstances,
therefore, it seemed an act of singular devotion on the part of Peter Jacobsen to have
come all the way from the Middle West, in the fourth year of war, on a visit to his old
friend Petherton, when the project entailed a single-handed struggle with two Great Powers
over the question of passports and the risk, when they had been obtained, of perishing
miserably by the way, a victim of frightfulness.</p>

<p>At the expense of much time and more trouble Jacobsen had at last arrived; the gulf
between Chicago and Blaybury was spanned. In the hall of Petherton’s house a scene of
welcome was being enacted under the dim gaze of six or seven <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-117">[Pg 117]</a></span>brown family portraits by unknown masters
of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p>

<p>Old Alfred Petherton, a grey shawl over his shoulders—for he had to be careful, even in
June, of draughts and colds—was shaking his guest’s hand with interminable cordiality.</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” he kept repeating, “it <i>is</i> a pleasure to see you. My dear boy
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Jacobsen limply abandoned his forearm and waited in patience.</p>

<p>“I can never be grateful enough,” Mr. Petherton went on—“never grateful enough to you
for having taken all this endless trouble to come and see an old decrepit man—for that’s
what I am now, that’s what I am, believe me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I assure you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” said Jacobsen, with vague deprecation. “Le vieux
crétin qui pleurniche,” he said to himself. French was a wonderfully expressive language,
to be sure.</p>

<p>“My digestion and my heart have got much worse since I saw you last. But I think I must
have told you about that in my letters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>“You did indeed, and I was most grieved to hear it.”</p>

<p>“Grieved”—what a curious flavour that word had! Like somebody’s tea which used to
recall the most delicious blends of forty years ago. But it was decidedly the <i>mot
juste</i>. It had the right obituary note about it.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mr. Petherton continued, “my palpitations are very bad now. Aren’t they,
Marjorie?” He appealed to his daughter who was standing beside him.</p>

<p>“Father’s palpitations are very bad,” she replied dutifully.</p>

<p>It was as though they were talking about some precious heirloom long and lovingly
cherished.</p>

<p>“And my digestion. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This physical infirmity makes all mental activity so
difficult. All the same, I manage to do a little useful work. We’ll discuss that later,
though. You must be feeling tired and dusty after your journey down. I’ll guide you to
your room. Marjorie, will you get someone to take up his luggage?”</p>

<p>“I can take it myself,” said Jacobsen, and he picked up a small gladstone-bag that had
been deposited by the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is that all?” Mr. Petherton asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all.”</p>

<p>As one living the life of reason, Jacobsen objected to owning things. One so easily
became the slave of things and not their master. He liked to be free; he checked his
possessive instincts and limited his possessions to the strictly essential. He was as much
or as little at home at Blaybury or Pekin. He could have explained all this if he liked.
But in the present case it wasn’t worth taking the trouble.</p>

<p>“This is your humble chamber,” said Mr. Petherton, throwing open the door of what was,
indeed, a very handsome spare-room, bright with chintzes and cut flowers and silver
candlesticks. “A poor thing, but your own.”</p>

<p>Courtly grace! Dear old man! Apt quotation! Jacobsen unpacked his bag and arranged its
contents neatly and methodically in the various drawers and shelves of the wardrobe.</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a good many years now since Jacobsen had come in the course of his grand
educational tour to Oxford. He <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-120">[Pg
120]</a></span>spent a couple of years there, for he liked the place, and its inhabitants
were a source of unfailing amusement to him.</p>

<p>A Norwegian, born in the Argentine, educated in the United States, in France, and in
Germany; a man with no nationality and no prejudices, enormously old in experience, he
found something very new and fresh and entertaining about his fellow-students with their
comic public-school traditions and fabulous ignorance of the world. He had quietly watched
them doing their little antics, feeling all the time that a row of bars separated them
from himself, and that he ought, after each particularly amusing trick, to offer them a
bun or a handful of pea-nuts. In the intervals of sight-seeing in this strange and
delightful Jardin des Plantes he read Greats, and it was through Aristotle that he had
come into contact with Alfred Petherton, fellow and tutor of his college.</p>

<p>The name of Petherton is a respectable one in the academic world. You will find it on
the title-page of such meritorious, if not exactly brilliant, books as <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-121">[Pg 121]</a></span><i>Plato’s
Predecessors</i>, <i>Three Scottish Metaphysicians</i>, <i>Introduction to the Study of
Ethics</i>, <i>Essays in Neo-Idealism</i>. Some of his works are published in cheap
editions as text-books.</p>

<p>One of those curious inexplicable friendships that often link the most unlikely people
had sprung up between tutor and pupil, and had lasted unbroken for upwards of twenty
years. Petherton felt a fatherly affection for the younger man, together with a father’s
pride, now that Jacobsen was a man of world-wide reputation, in having, as he supposed,
spiritually begotten him. And now Jacobsen had travelled three or four thousand miles
across a world at war just to see the old man. Petherton was profoundly touched.</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Did you see any submarines on the way over?” Marjorie asked, as she and Jacobsen were
strolling together in the garden after breakfast the next day.</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice any; but then I am very unobservant about these things.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. At last, “I suppose <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-122">[Pg 122]</a></span>there is a great deal of war-work being done in America
now?” said Marjorie.</p>

<p>Jacobsen supposed so; and there floated across his mind a vision of massed bands, of
orators with megaphones, of patriotic sky-signs, of streets made perilous by the organized
highway robbery of Red Cross collectors. He was too lazy to describe it all; besides, she
wouldn’t see the point of it.</p>

<p>“I should like to be able to do some war-work,” Marjorie explained apologetically. “But
I have to look after father, and there’s the housekeeping, so I really haven’t the
time.”</p>

<p>Jacobsen thought he detected a formula for the benefit of strangers. She evidently
wanted to make things right about herself in people’s minds. Her remark about the
housekeeping made Jacobsen think of the late Mrs. Petherton, her mother; she had been a
good-looking, painfully sprightly woman with a hankering to shine in University society at
Oxford. One quickly learned that she was related to bishops and country families; a hunter
of ecclesiastical <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-123">[Pg
123]</a></span>lions and a snob. He felt glad she was dead.</p>

<p>“Won’t it be awful when there’s no war-work,” he said. “People will have nothing to do
or think about when peace comes.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad. Housekeeping will be so much easier.”</p>

<p>“True. There are consolations.”</p>

<p>Marjorie looked at him suspiciously; she didn’t like being laughed at. What an
undistinguished-looking little man he was! Short, stoutish, with waxed brown moustaches
and a forehead that incipient baldness had made interminably high. He looked like the sort
of man to whom one says: “Thank you, I’ll take it in notes with a pound’s worth of
silver.” There were pouches under his eyes and pouches under his chin, and you could never
guess from his expression what he was thinking about. She was glad that she was taller
than he and could look down on him.</p>

<p>Mr. Petherton appeared from the house, his grey shawl over his shoulders and the
crackling expanse of the <i>Times</i> between his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good morrow,” he cried.</p>

<p>To the Shakespearian heartiness of this greeting Marjorie returned her most icily
modern “Morning.” Her father always said “Good morrow” instead of “Good morning,” and the
fact irritated her with unfailing regularity every day of her life.</p>

<p>“There’s a most interesting account,” said Mr. Petherton, “by a young pilot of an air
fight in to-day’s paper,” and as they walked up and down the gravel path he read the
article, which was a column and a half in length.</p>

<p>Marjorie made no attempt to disguise her boredom, and occupied herself by reading
something on the other side of the page, craning her neck round to see.</p>

<p>“Very interesting,” said Jacobsen when it was finished.</p>

<p>Mr. Petherton had turned over and was now looking at the Court Circular page.</p>

<p>“I see,” he said, “there’s someone called Beryl Camberley-Belcher going to be married.
Do you know if that’s any relation of the Howard Camberley-Belchers, Marjorie?”</p>

<p>“I’ve no idea who the Howard Camberley-Belchers <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-125">[Pg 125]</a></span>are,” Marjorie answered rather
sharply.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought you did. Let me see. Howard Camberley-Belcher was at college with me.
And he had a brother called James—or was it William?—and a sister who married one of the
Riders, or at any rate some relation of the Riders; for I know the Camberley-Belchers and
the Riders used to fit in somewhere. Dear me, I’m afraid my memory for names is
going.”</p>

<p>Marjorie went indoors to prepare the day’s domestic campaign with the cook. When that
was over she retired to her sitting-room and unlocked her very private desk. She must
write to Guy this morning. Marjorie had known Guy Lambourne for years and years, almost as
long as she could remember. The Lambournes were old family friends of the Pethertons:
indeed they were, distantly, connections; they “fitted in somewhere,” as Mr. Petherton
would say—somewhere, about a couple of generations back. Marjorie was two years younger
than Guy; they were both only children; circumstances had naturally thrown them <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-126">[Pg 126]</a></span>a great deal together.
Then Guy’s father had died, and not long afterwards his mother, and at the age of
seventeen Guy had actually come to live with the Pethertons, for the old man was his
guardian. And now they were engaged; had been, more or less, from the first year of the
war.</p>

<p>Marjorie took pen, ink, and paper. “D<small>EAR</small> G<small>UY</small>,” she
began—(“<i>We</i> aren’t sentimental,” she had once remarked, with a mixture of contempt
and secret envy, to a friend who had confided that she and her fiancé never began with
anything less than Darling.)—“I am longing for another of your letters. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
She went through the usual litany of longing. “It was father’s birthday yesterday; he is
sixty-five. I cannot bear to think that some day you and I will be as old as that. Aunt
Ellen sent him a Stilton cheese—a useful war-time present. How boring housekeeping is. By
dint of thinking about cheeses my mind is rapidly turning into one—a Gruyère; where there
isn’t cheese there are just holes, full of vacuum .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>She didn’t really mind housekeeping so <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-127">[Pg 127]</a></span>much. She took it for granted, and did it just because it
was there to be done. Guy, on the contrary, never took anything for granted; she made
these demonstrations for his benefit.</p>

<p>“I read Keats’s letters, as you suggested, and thought them <i>too</i> beautiful
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>At the end of a page of rapture she paused and bit her pen. What was there to say next?
It seemed absurd one should have to write letters about the books one had been reading.
But there was nothing else to write about; nothing ever happened. After all, what had
happened in her life? Her mother dying when she was sixteen; then the excitement of Guy
coming to live with them; then the war, but that hadn’t meant much to her; then Guy
falling in love, and their getting engaged. That was really all. She wished she could
write about her feelings in an accurate, complicated way, like people in novels; but when
she came to think about it, she didn’t seem to have any feelings to describe.</p>

<p>She looked at Guy’s last letter from France. ”Sometimes,” he had written, “I am
tortured by an intense physical <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-128">[Pg
128]</a></span>desire for you. I can think of nothing but your beauty, your young, strong
body. I hate that; I have to struggle to repress it. Do you forgive me?” It rather
thrilled her that he should feel like that about her: he had always been so cold, so
reserved, so much opposed to sentimentality—to the kisses and endearments she would,
perhaps, secretly have liked. But he had seemed so right when he said, “We must love like
rational beings, with our minds, not with our hands and lips.” All the same
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>She dipped her pen in the ink and began to write again. “I know the feelings you spoke
of in your letter. Sometimes I long for you in the same way. I dreamt the other night I
was holding you in my arms, and woke up hugging the pillow.” She looked at what she had
written. It was too awful, too vulgar! She would have to scratch it out. But no, she would
leave it in spite of everything, just to see what he would think about it. She finished
the letter quickly, sealed and stamped it, and rang for the maid to take it to the post.
When the servant had gone, she shut up her desk with a bang. Bang—the letter had gone,
irrevocably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>She picked up a large book lying on the table and began to read. It was the first
volume of the <i>Decline and Fall</i>. Guy had said she must read Gibbon; she wouldn’t be
educated till she had read Gibbon. And so yesterday she had gone to her father in his
library to get the book.</p>

<p>“Gibbon,” Mr. Petherton had said, “certainly, my dear. How delightful it is to look at
these grand old books again. One always finds something new every time.”</p>

<p>Marjorie gave him to understand that she had never read it. She felt rather proud of
her ignorance.</p>

<p>Mr. Petherton handed the first of eleven volumes to her. “A great book,” he
murmured—“an essential book. It fills the gap between your classical history and your
mediæval stuff.”</p>

<p>“Your” classical history, Marjorie repeated to herself, “your” classical history
indeed! Her father had an irritating way of taking it for granted that she knew
everything, that classical history was as much hers as his. Only a day or two before he
had turned to her at luncheon with, “Do you remember, dear <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-130">[Pg 130]</a></span>child, whether it was Pomponazzi who
denied the personal immortality of the soul, or else that queer fellow, Laurentius Valla?
It’s gone out of my head for the moment.” Marjorie had quite lost her temper at the
question—much to the innocent bewilderment of her poor father.</p>

<p>She had set to work with energy on the Gibbon; her bookmarker registered the fact that
she had got through one hundred and twenty-three pages yesterday. Marjorie started
reading. After two pages she stopped. She looked at the number of pages still remaining to
be read—and this was only the first volume. She felt like a wasp sitting down to eat a
vegetable marrow. Gibbon’s bulk was not perceptibly diminished by her first bite. It was
too long. She shut the book and went out for a walk. Passing the Whites’ house, she saw
her friend, Beatrice White that was, sitting on the lawn with her two babies. Beatrice
hailed her, and she turned in.</p>

<p>“Pat a cake, pat a cake,” she said. At the age of ten months, baby John had already
learnt the art of patting cakes. He slapped the outstretched hand offered <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-131">[Pg 131]</a></span>him, and his face,
round and smooth and pink like an enormous peach, beamed with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he a darling!” Marjorie exclaimed. “You know, I’m sure he’s grown since last I
saw him, which was on Tuesday.”</p>

<p>“He put on eleven ounces last week,” Beatrice affirmed.</p>

<p>“How wonderful! His hair’s coming on splendidly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was Sunday the next day. Jacobsen appeared at breakfast in the neatest of black
suits. He looked, Marjorie thought, more than ever like a cashier. She longed to tell him
to hurry up or he’d miss the 8.53 for the second time this week and the manager would be
annoyed. Marjorie herself was, rather consciously, not in Sunday best.</p>

<p>“What is the name of the Vicar?” Jacobsen inquired, as he helped himself to bacon.</p>

<p>“Trubshaw. Luke Trubshaw, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Does he preach well?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t when I used to hear him. <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-132">[Pg 132]</a></span>But I don’t often go to church now, so I don’t know what
he’s like these days.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go to church?” Jacobsen inquired, with a silkiness of tone which veiled
the crude outlines of his leading question.</p>

<p>Marjorie was painfully conscious of blushing. She was filled with rage against
Jacobsen. “Because,” she said firmly, “I don’t think it necessary to give expression to my
religious feelings by making a lot of”—she hesitated a moment—“a lot of meaningless
gestures with a crowd of other people.”</p>

<p>“You used to go,” said Jacobsen.</p>

<p>“When I was a child and hadn’t thought about these things.”</p>

<p>Jacobsen was silent, and concealed a smile in his coffee-cup. Really, he said to
himself, there ought to be religious conscription for women—and for most men, too. It was
grotesque the way these people thought they could stand by themselves—the fools, when
there was the infinite authority of organized religion to support their ridiculous
feebleness.</p>

<p>“Does Lambourne go to church?” <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-133">[Pg 133]</a></span>he asked maliciously, and with an air of perfect naïveté
and good faith.</p>

<p>Marjorie coloured again, and a fresh wave of hatred surged up within her. Even as she
had said the words she had wondered whether Jacobsen would notice that the phrase
“meaningless gestures” didn’t ring very much like one of her own coinages. “Gesture”—that
was one of Guy’s words, like “incredible,” “exacerbate,” “impinge,” “sinister.” Of course
all her present views about religion had come from Guy. She looked Jacobsen straight in
the face and replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, I think he goes to church pretty regularly. But I really don’t know: his religion
has nothing to do with me.”</p>

<p>Jacobsen was lost in delight and admiration.</p>

<p>Punctually at twenty minutes to eleven he set out for church. From where she was
sitting in the summer-house Marjorie watched him as he crossed the garden, incredibly
absurd and incongruous in his black clothes among the blazing flowers and the young
emerald of the trees. Now he was hidden behind the sweet-briar hedge, all except the hard
black melon of <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-134">[Pg
134]</a></span>his bowler hat, which she could see bobbing along between the topmost
sprays.</p>

<p>She went on with her letter to Guy. “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What a strange man Mr. Jacobsen
is. I suppose he is very clever, but I can’t get very much out of him. We had an argument
about religion at breakfast this morning; I rather scored off him. He has now gone off to
church all by himself;—I really couldn’t face the prospect of going with him—I hope he’ll
enjoy old Mr. Trubshaw’s preaching!”</p>

<p>Jacobsen did enjoy Mr. Trubshaw’s preaching enormously. He always made a point, in
whatever part of Christendom he happened to be, of attending divine service. He had the
greatest admiration of churches as institutions. In their solidity and unchangeableness he
saw one of the few hopes for humanity. Further, he derived great pleasure from comparing
the Church as an institution—splendid, powerful, eternal—with the childish imbecility of
its representatives. How delightful it was to sit in the herded congregation and listen to
the sincere outpourings of an intellect only a little less limited than that of an
Australian <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-135">[Pg
135]</a></span>aboriginal! How restful to feel oneself a member of a flock, guided by a
good shepherd—himself a sheep! Then there was the scientific interest (he went to church
as student of anthropology, as a Freudian psychologist) and the philosophic amusement of
counting the undistributed middles and tabulating historically the exploded fallacies in
the parson’s discourse.</p>

<p>To-day Mr. Trubshaw preached a topical sermon about the Irish situation. His was the
gospel of the <i>Morning Post</i>, slightly tempered by Christianity. It was our duty, he
said, to pray for the Irish first of all, and if that had no effect upon recruiting, why,
then, we must conscribe them as zealously as we had prayed before.</p>

<p>Jacobsen leaned back in his pew with a sigh of contentment. A connoisseur, he
recognized that this was the right stuff.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Petherton over the Sunday beef at lunch, “how did you like our dear
Vicar?”</p>

<p>“He was splendid,” said Jacobsen, with grave enthusiasm. “One of the best sermons I’ve
ever heard.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? I shall really have to go and <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-136">[Pg 136]</a></span>hear him again. It must be nearly ten years since I
listened to him.”</p>

<p>“He’s inimitable.”</p>

<p>Marjorie looked at Jacobsen carefully. He seemed to be perfectly serious. She was more
than ever puzzled by the man.</p>

<p>The days went slipping by, hot blue days that passed like a flash almost without one’s
noticing them, cold grey days, seeming interminable and without number, and about which
one spoke with a sense of justified grievance, for the season was supposed to be summer.
There was fighting going on in France—terrific battles, to judge from the headlines in the
<i>Times</i>; but, after all, one day’s paper was very much like another’s. Marjorie read
them dutifully, but didn’t honestly take in very much; at least she forgot about things
very soon. She couldn’t keep count with the battles of Ypres, and when somebody told her
that she ought to go and see the photographs of the <i>Vindictive</i>, she smiled vaguely
and said Yes, without remembering precisely what the <i>Vindictive</i> was—a ship, she
supposed.</p>

<p>Guy was in France, to be sure, but he was an Intelligence Officer now, so that <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-137">[Pg 137]</a></span>she was hardly anxious
about him at all. Clergymen used to say that the war was bringing us all back to a sense
of the fundamental realities of life. She supposed it was true: Guy’s enforced absences
were a pain to her, and the difficulties of housekeeping continually increased and
multiplied.</p>

<p>Mr. Petherton took a more intelligent interest in the war than did his daughter. He
prided himself on being able to see the thing as a whole, on taking an historical,
God’s-eye view of it all. He talked about it at meal-times, insisting that the world must
be made safe for democracy. Between meals he sat in the library working at his monumental
History of Morals. To his dinner-table disquisitions Marjorie would listen more or less
attentively, Jacobsen with an unfailing, bright, intelligent politeness. Jacobsen himself
rarely volunteered a remark about the war; it was taken for granted that he thought about
it in the same way as all other right-thinking folk. Between meals he worked in his room
or discussed the morals of the Italian Renaissance with his host. Marjorie <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-138">[Pg 138]</a></span>could write to Guy
that nothing was happening, and that but for his absence and the weather interfering so
much with tennis, she would be perfectly happy.</p>

<p>Into the midst of this placidity there fell, delightful bolt from the blue, the
announcement that Guy was getting leave at the end of July. “D<small>ARLING</small>,”
Marjorie wrote, “I am so excited to think that you will be with me in such a little—such a
long, long time.” Indeed, she was so excited and delighted that she realized with a touch
of remorse how comparatively little she had thought of him when there seemed no chance of
seeing him, how dim a figure in absence he was. A week later she heard that George White
had arranged to get leave at the same time so as to see Guy. She was glad; George was a
charming boy, and Guy was so fond of him. The Whites were their nearest neighbours, and
ever since Guy had come to live at Blaybury he had seen a great deal of young George.</p>

<p>“We shall be a most festive party,” said Mr. Petherton. “Roger will be coming to us
just at the same time as Guy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d quite forgotten Uncle Roger,” said Marjorie. “Of course, his holidays begin then,
don’t they?”</p>

<p>The Reverend Roger was Alfred Petherton’s brother and a master at one of our most
glorious public schools. Marjorie hardly agreed with her father in thinking that his
presence would add anything to the “festiveness” of the party. It was a pity he should be
coming at this particular moment. However, we all have our little cross to bear.</p>

<p>Mr. Petherton was feeling playful. “We must bring down,” he said, “the choicest
Falernian, bottled when Gladstone was consul, for the occasion. We must prepare wreaths
and unguents and hire a flute player and a couple of dancing girls .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>He spent the rest of the meal in quoting Horace, Catullus, the Greek Anthology,
Petronius, and Sidonius Apollinarius. Marjorie’s knowledge of the dead languages was
decidedly limited. Her thoughts were elsewhere, and it was only dimly and as it were
through a mist that she heard her father murmuring—whether merely to himself or with the
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-140">[Pg 140]</a></span>hope of
eliciting an answer from somebody, she hardly knew—“Let me see: how does that epigram
go?—that one about the different kinds of fish and the garlands of roses, by Meleager, or
is it Poseidippus? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h4 id="Happily_02">II</h4>

<p class="noindent">G<small>UY</small> and Jacobsen were walking in the Dutch garden, an
incongruous couple. On Guy military servitude had left no outwardly visible mark; out of
uniform, he still looked like a tall, untidy undergraduate; he stooped and drooped as much
as ever; his hair was still bushy and, to judge by the dim expression of his face, he had
not yet learnt to think imperially. His khaki always looked like a disguise, like the most
absurd fancy dress. Jacobsen trotted beside him, short, fattish, very sleek, and correct.
They talked in a desultory way about things indifferent. Guy, anxious for a little
intellectual exercise after so many months of discipline, had been trying to inveigle his
companion into a philosophical discussion. Jacobsen consistently <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-141">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;[Pg
141]</a></span>eluded his efforts; he was too lazy to talk seriously; there was no profit
that he could see to be got out of this young man’s opinions, and he had not the faintest
desire to make a disciple. He preferred, therefore, to discuss the war and the weather. It
irritated him that people should want to trespass on the domain of thought—people who had
no right to live anywhere but on the vegetative plane of mere existence. He wished they
would simply be content to <i>be</i> or <i>do</i>, not try, so hopelessly, to think, when
only one in a million can think with the least profit to himself or anyone else.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye he looked at the dark, sensitive face of his companion; he
ought to have gone into business at eighteen, was Jacobsen’s verdict. It was bad for him
to think; he wasn’t strong enough.</p>

<p>A great sound of barking broke upon the calm of the garden. Looking up, the two
strollers saw George White running across the green turf of the croquet lawn with a huge
fawn-coloured dog bounding along at his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Morning,” he shouted. He was hatless and out of breath. “I was taking Bella for a run,
and thought I’d look in and see how you all were.”</p>

<p>“What a lovely dog!” Jacobsen exclaimed.</p>

<p>“An old English mastiff our—one aboriginal dog. She has a pedigree going straight back
to Edward the Confessor.”</p>

<p>Jacobsen began a lively conversation with George on the virtues and shortcomings of
dogs. Bella smelt his calves and then lifted up her gentle black eyes to look at him. She
seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>He looked at them for a little; they were too much absorbed in their doggy conversation
to pay attention to him. He made a gesture as though he had suddenly remembered something,
gave a little grunt, and with a very preoccupied expression on his face turned to go
towards the house. His elaborate piece of by-play escaped the notice of the intended
spectators; Guy saw that it had, and felt more miserable and angry and jealous than ever.
They would think he had slunk off because he wasn’t wanted—which was quite true—instead
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-143">[Pg 143]</a></span>of believing
that he had something very important to do, which was what he had intended they should
believe.</p>

<p>A cloud of self-doubt settled upon him. Was his mind, after all, worthless, and the
little things he had written—rubbish, not potential genius as he had hoped? Jacobsen was
right in preferring George’s company. George was perfect, physically, a splendid creature;
what could he himself claim?</p>

<p>“I’m second-rate,” he thought—“second-rate, physically, morally, mentally. Jacobsen is
quite right.”</p>

<p>The best he could hope to be was a pedestrian literary man with quiet tastes.</p>

<p>NO, no, no! He clenched his hands and, as though to register his resolve before the
universe, he said, aloud:</p>

<p>“I will do it; I will be first-rate, I will.”</p>

<p>He was covered with confusion on seeing a gardener pop up, surprised from behind a bank
of rose-bushes. Talking to himself—the man must have thought him mad!</p>

<p>He hurried on across the lawn, entered the house, and ran upstairs to his room. <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-144">[Pg 144]</a></span>There was not a second
to lose; he must begin at once. He would write something—something that would last, solid,
hard, shining. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“Damn them all! I will do it, I can .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>There were writing materials and a table in his room. He selected a pen—with a Relief
nib he would be able to go on for hours without getting tired—and a large square sheet of
writing-paper.</p>

<blockquote class="stationery">
<p class="house">“H<small>ATCH</small> H<small>OUSE</small>,</p>

<p class="town">B<small>LAYBURY</small>,</p>

<p class="county">W<small>ILTS</small>.</p>

<p>Station: Cogham, 3 miles; Nobes Monacorum, 4½ miles.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stupid of people to have their stationery printed in red, when black or blue is so much
nicer! He inked over the letters.</p>

<p>He held up the paper to the light; there was a watermark, “Pimlico Bond.” What an
admirable name for the hero of a novel! Pimlico Bond. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<blockquote class="verse">
<p class="i2">“There’s be-eef in the la-arder</p>

<p class="i2a">And du-ucks in the pond;</p>

<p class="i2a">Crying dilly dilly, dilly dilly&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">He bit the end of his pen. “What I want to get,” he said to himself,
“is something very hard, very external. Intense emotion, but one will somehow have got
outside it.” He made a movement of hands, arms, and shoulders, tightening his muscles in
an effort to express to himself physically that hardness and tightness and firmness of
style after which he was struggling!</p>

<p>He began to draw on his virgin paper. A woman, naked, one arm lifted over her head, so
that it pulled up her breast by that wonderful curving muscle that comes down from the
shoulder. The inner surface of the thighs, remember, is slightly concave. The feet, seen
from the front, are always a difficulty.</p>

<p>It would never do to leave that about. What would the servants think? He turned the
nipples into eyes, drew heavy lines for nose, mouth, and chin, slopped on the ink thick;
it made a passable face now—though an acute observer might have detected the original
nudity. He tore it up into very small pieces.</p>

<p>A crescendo booming filled the house. It was the gong. He looked at his watch. <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-146">[Pg 146]</a></span>Lunch-time, and he had
done nothing. O God! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h4 id="Happily_03">III</h4>

<p class="noindent">I<small>T</small> was dinner-time on the last evening of Guy’s leave.
The uncovered mahogany table was like a pool of brown unruffled water within whose depths
flowers and the glinting shapes of glass and silver hung dimly reflected. Mr. Petherton
sat at the head of the board, flanked by his brother Roger and Jacobsen. Youth, in the
persons of Marjorie, Guy, and George White, had collected at the other end. They had
reached the stage of dessert.</p>

<p>“This is excellent port,” said Roger, sleek and glossy like a well-fed black cob under
his silken clerical waistcoat. He was a strong, thick-set man of about fifty, with a red
neck as thick as his head. His hair was cropped with military closeness; he liked to set a
good example to the boys, some of whom showed distressing “æsthetic” tendencies and wore
their hair long.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you like it. I mayn’t touch it myself, of course. Have another <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-147">[Pg 147]</a></span>glass.” Alfred
Petherton’s face wore an expression of dyspeptic melancholy. He was wishing he hadn’t
taken quite so much of that duck.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I will.” Roger took the decanter with a smile of satisfaction. “The tired
schoolmaster is worthy of his second glass. White, you look rather pale; I think you must
have another.” Roger had a hearty, jocular manner, calculated to prove to his pupils that
he was not one of the slimy sort of parsons, not a Creeping Jesus.</p>

<p>There was an absorbing conversation going on at the youthful end of the table. Secretly
irritated at having been thus interrupted in the middle of it, White turned round and
smiled vaguely at Roger.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, sir,” he said, and pushed his glass forward to be filled. The “sir”
slipped out unawares; it was, after all, such a little while since he had been a schoolboy
under Roger’s dominion.</p>

<p>“One is lucky,” Roger went on seriously, “to get any port wine at all now. I’m thankful
to say I bought ten dozen <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-148">[Pg
148]</a></span>from my old college some years ago to lay down; otherwise I don’t know what
I should do. My wine merchant tells me he couldn’t let me have a single bottle. Indeed, he
offered to buy some off me, if I’d sell. But I wasn’t having any. A bottle in the cellar
is worth ten shillings in the pocket these days. I always say that port has become a
necessity now one gets so little meat. Lambourne! you are another of our brave defenders;
you deserve a second glass.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” said Guy, hardly looking up. “I’ve had enough.” He went on talking to
Marjorie—about the different views of life held by the French and the Russians.</p>

<p>Roger helped himself to cherries. “One has to select them carefully,” he remarked for
the benefit of the unwillingly listening George. “There is nothing that gives you such
stomach-aches as unripe cherries.”</p>

<p>“I expect you’re glad, Mr. Petherton, that holidays have begun at last?” said
Jacobsen.</p>

<p>“Glad? I should think so. One is <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-149">[Pg 149]</a></span>utterly dead beat at the end of the summer term. Isn’t
one, White?”</p>

<p>White had taken the opportunity to turn back again and listen to Guy’s conversation;
recalled, like a dog who has started off on a forbidden scent, he obediently assented that
one did get tired at the end of the summer term.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Jacobsen, “you still teach the same old things—Cæsar, Latin verses,
Greek grammar, and the rest? We Americans can hardly believe that all that still goes
on.”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness,” said Roger, “we still hammer a little solid stuff into them. But
there’s been a great deal of fuss lately about new curriculums and so forth. They do a lot
of science now and things of that kind, but I don’t believe the children learn anything at
all. It’s pure waste of time.”</p>

<p>“So is all education, I dare say,” said Jacobsen lightly.</p>

<p>“Not if you teach them discipline. That’s what’s wanted—discipline. Most of these
little boys need plenty of beating, and they don’t get enough now. Besides, if you can’t
hammer knowledge <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-150">[Pg
150]</a></span>in at their heads, you can at least beat a little in at their tails.”</p>

<p>“You’re very ferocious, Roger,” said Mr. Petherton, smiling. He was feeling better; the
duck was settling down.</p>

<p>“No, it’s the vital thing. The best thing the war has brought us is discipline. The
country had got slack and wanted tightening up.” Roger’s face glowed with zeal.</p>

<p>From the other end of the table Guy’s voice could be heard saying, “Do you know César
Franck’s ‘Dieu s’avance à travers la lande’? It’s one of the finest bits of religious
music I know.”</p>

<p>Mr. Petherton’s face lighted up; he leaned forward. “No,” he said, throwing his answer
unexpectedly into the midst of the young people’s conversation. “I don’t know it; but do
you know this? Wait a minute.” He knitted his brows, and his lips moved as though he were
trying to recapture a formula. “Ah, I’ve got it. Now, can you tell me this? The name of
what famous piece of religious music do I utter when I order an old carpenter, once a
Liberal <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-151">[Pg 151]</a></span>but now
a renegade to Conservatism, to make a hive for bees?”</p>

<p>Guy gave it up; his guardian beamed delightedly.</p>

<p>“Hoary Tory, oh, Judas! Make a bee-house,” he said. “Do you see? Oratorio <i>Judas
Maccabeus.</i>”</p>

<p>Guy could have wished that this bit of flotsam from Mr. Petherton’s sportive youth had
not been thus washed up at his feet. He felt that he had been peeping indecently close
into the dark backward and abysm of time.</p>

<p>“That was a good one,” Mr. Petherton chuckled. “I must see if I can think of some
more.”</p>

<p>Roger, who was not easily to be turned away from his favourite topic, waited till this
irrelevant spark of levity had quite expired, and continued: “It’s a remarkable and
noticeable fact that you never seem to get discipline combined with the teaching of
science or modern languages. Who ever heard of a science master having a good house at a
school? Scientists’ houses are always bad.”</p>

<p>“How very strange!” said Jacobsen.</p>

<p>“Strange, but a fact. It seems to me <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-152">[Pg 152]</a></span>a great mistake to give them houses at all if they can’t
keep discipline. And then there’s the question of religion. Some of these men never come
to chapel except when they’re on duty. And then, I ask you, what happens when they prepare
their boys for Confirmation? Why, I’ve known boys come to me who were supposed to have
been prepared by one or other of these men, and, on asking them, I’ve found that they know
nothing whatever about the most solemn facts of the Eucharist.—May I have some more of
those excellent cherries please, White?—Of course, I do my best in such cases to tell the
boys what I feel personally about these solemn things. But there generally isn’t the time;
one’s life is so crowded; and so they go into Confirmation with only the very haziest
knowledge of what it’s all about. You see how absurd it is to let anyone but the classical
men have anything to do with the boys’ lives.”</p>

<p>“Shake it well, dear,” Mr. Petherton was saying to his daughter, who had come with his
medicine.</p>

<p>“What is that stuff?” asked Roger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s merely my peptones. I can hardly digest at all without it, you know.”</p>

<p>“You have all my sympathies. My poor colleague, Flexner, suffers from chronic colitis.
I can’t imagine how he goes on with his work.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed. I find I can do nothing strenuous.”</p>

<p>Roger turned and seized once more on the unhappy George. “White,” he said, “let this be
a lesson to you. Take care of your inside; it’s the secret of a happy old age.”</p>

<p>Guy looked up quickly. “Don’t worry about his old age,” he said in a strange harsh
voice, very different from the gentle, elaborately modulated tone in which he generally
spoke. “He won’t have an old age. His chances against surviving are about fourteen to
three if the war goes on another year.”</p>

<p>“Come,” said Roger, “don’t let’s be pessimistic.”</p>

<p>“But I’m not. I assure you, I’m giving you a most rosy view of George’s chance of
reaching old age.”</p>

<p>It was felt that Guy’s remarks had been <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-154">[Pg 154]</a></span>in poor taste. There was a silence; eyes floated vaguely
and uneasily, trying not to encounter one another. Roger cracked a nut loudly. When he had
sufficiently relished the situation, Jacobsen changed the subject by remarking:</p>

<p>“That was a fine bit of work by our destroyers this morning, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It did one good to read about it,” said Mr. Petherton. “Quite the Nelson touch.”</p>

<p>Roger raised his glass. “Nelson!” he said, and emptied it at a gulp. “What a man! I am
trying to persuade the Headmaster to make Trafalgar Day a holiday. It is the best way of
reminding boys of things of that sort.”</p>

<p>“A curiously untypical Englishman to be a national hero, isn’t he?” said Jacobsen. “So
emotional and lacking in Britannic phlegm.”</p>

<p>The Reverend Roger looked grave. “There’s one thing I’ve never been able to understand
about Nelson, and that is, how a man who was so much the soul of honour and of patriotism
could have been—er—immoral with Lady Hamilton. <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-155">[Pg 155]</a></span>I know people say that it was the custom of the age, that
these things meant nothing then, and so forth; but all the same, I repeat, I cannot
understand how a man who was so intensely a patriotic Englishman could have done such a
thing.”</p>

<p>“I fail to see what patriotism has got to do with it,” said Guy.</p>

<p>Roger fixed him with his most pedagogic look and said slowly and gravely, “Then I am
sorry for you. I shouldn’t have thought it was necessary to tell an Englishman that purity
of morals is a national tradition: you especially, a public-school man.”</p>

<p>“Let us go and have a hundred up at billiards,” said Mr. Petherton. “Roger, will you
come? And you, George, and Guy?”</p>

<p>“I’m so incredibly bad,” Guy insisted, “I’d really rather not.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Jacobsen.</p>

<p>“Then, Marjorie, you must make the fourth.”</p>

<p>The billiard players trooped out; Guy and Jacobsen were left alone, brooding over the
wreckage of dinner. There was <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-156">[Pg
156]</a></span>a long silence. The two men sat smoking, Guy sitting in a sagging, crumpled
attitude, like a half-empty sack abandoned on a chair, Jacobsen very upright and
serene.</p>

<p>“Do you find you can suffer fools gladly?” asked Guy abruptly.</p>

<p>“Perfectly gladly.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could. The Reverend Roger has a tendency to make my blood boil.”</p>

<p>“But such a good soul,” Jacobsen insisted.</p>

<p>“I dare say, but a monster all the same.”</p>

<p>“You should take him more calmly. I make a point of never letting myself be moved by
external things. I stick to my writing and thinking. Truth is beauty, beauty is truth, and
so forth: after all, they’re the only things of solid value.” Jacobsen looked at the young
man with a smile as he said these words. There is no doubt, he said to himself, that that
boy ought to have gone into business; what a mistake this higher education is, to be
sure.</p>

<p>“Of course, they’re the only things,” Guy burst out passionately. “You can afford to
say so because you had the luck <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-157">[Pg
157]</a></span>to be born twenty years before I was, and with five thousand miles of good
deep water between you and Europe. Here am I, called upon to devote my life, in a very
different way from which you devote yours to truth and beauty—to devote my life to—well,
what? I’m not quite sure, but I preserve a touching faith that it is good. And you tell me
to ignore external circumstances. Come and live in Flanders a little and try
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He launched forth into a tirade about agony and death and blood and
putrefaction.</p>

<p>“What is one to do?” he concluded despairingly. “What the devil is right? I had meant
to spend my life writing and thinking, trying to create something beautiful or discover
something true. But oughtn’t one, after all, if one survives, to give up everything else
and try to make this hideous den of a world a little more habitable?”</p>

<p>“I think you can take it that a world which has let itself be dragooned into this
criminal folly is pretty hopeless. Follow your inclinations; or, better, go into a bank
and make a lot of money.”</p>

<p>Guy burst out laughing, rather too <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-158">[Pg 158]</a></span>loudly. “Admirable, admirable!” he said. “To return to
our old topic of fools: frankly, Jacobsen, I cannot imagine why you should elect to pass
your time with my dear old guardian. He’s a charming old man, but one must admit——” He
waved his hand.</p>

<p>“One must live somewhere,” said Jacobsen. “I find your guardian a most interesting man
to be with.—Oh, do look at that dog!” On the hearth-rug Marjorie’s little Pekingese,
Confucius, was preparing to lie down and go to sleep. He went assiduously through the
solemn farce of scratching the floor, under the impression, no doubt, that he was making a
comfortable nest to lie in. He turned round and round, scratching earnestly and
methodically. Then he lay down, curled himself up in a ball, and was asleep in the
twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that too wonderfully human!” exclaimed Jacobsen delightedly. Guy thought he
could see now why Jacobsen enjoyed living with Mr. Petherton. The old man was so
wonderfully human.</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later in the evening, when the billiards <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-159">[Pg 159]</a></span>was over and Mr. Petherton had duly commented on the
anachronism of introducing the game into Anthony and Cleopatra, Guy and Marjorie went for
a stroll in the garden. The moon had risen above the trees and lit up the front of the
house with its bright pale light that could not wake the sleeping colours of the
world.</p>

<p>“Moonlight is the proper architectural light,” said Guy, as they stood looking at the
house. The white light and the hard black shadows brought out all the elegance of its
Georgian symmetry.</p>

<p>“Look, here’s the ghost of a rose.” Marjorie touched a big cool flower, which one
guessed rather than saw to be red, a faint equivocal lunar crimson. “And, oh, smell the
tobacco-plant flowers. Aren’t they delicious!”</p>

<p>“I always think there’s something very mysterious about perfume drifting through the
dark like this. It seems to come from some perfectly different immaterial world, peopled
by unembodied sensations, phantom passions. Think of the spiritual effect of incense in a
dark church. One isn’t surprised that people have believed in the existence of the
soul.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>They walked on in silence. Sometimes, accidentally, his hand would brush against hers
in the movement of their march. Guy felt an intolerable emotion of expectancy, akin to
fear. It made him feel almost physically sick.</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” he said abruptly, “that summer holiday our families spent together
in Wales? It must have been nineteen four or five. I was ten and you were eight or
thereabouts.”</p>

<p>“Of course I remember,” cried Marjorie. “Everything. There was that funny little toy
railway from the slate quarries.”</p>

<p>“And do you remember our gold-mine? All those tons of yellow ironstone we collected and
hoarded in a cave, fully believing they were nuggets. How incredibly remote it seems!”</p>

<p>“And you had a wonderful process by which you tested whether the stuff was real gold or
not. It all passed triumphantly as genuine, I remember!”</p>

<p>“Having that secret together first made us friends, I believe.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” said Marjorie. “Fourteen years ago—what a time! And you <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-161">[Pg 161]</a></span>began educating me
even then: all that stuff you told me about gold-mining, for instance.”</p>

<p>“Fourteen years,” Guy repeated reflectively, “and I shall be going out again to-morrow
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak about it. I am so miserable when you’re away.” She genuinely forgot what a
delightful summer she had had, except for the shortage of tennis.</p>

<p>“We must make this the happiest hour of our lives. Perhaps it may be the last we shall
be together.” Guy looked up at the moon, and he perceived, with a sudden start, that it
was a sphere islanded in an endless night, not a flat disk stuck on a wall not so very far
away. It filled him with an infinite dreariness; he felt too insignificant to live at
all.</p>

<p>“Guy, you mustn’t talk like that,” said Marjorie appealingly.</p>

<p>“We’ve got twelve hours,” said Guy in a meditative voice, “but that’s only clock-work
time. You can give an hour the quality of everlastingness, and spend years which are as
though they had never been. We get our immortality here and now; it’s a question of
quality, not of quantity. <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-162">[Pg
162]</a></span>I don’t look forward to golden harps or anything of that sort. I know that
when I am dead, I shall be dead; there isn’t any afterwards. If I’m killed, my immortality
will be in your memory. Perhaps, too, somebody will read the things I’ve written, and in
his mind I shall survive, feebly and partially. But in your mind I shall survive intact
and whole.”</p>

<p>“But I’m sure we shall go on living after death. It can’t be the end.” Marjorie was
conscious that she had heard those words before. Where? Oh yes, it was earnest Evangeline
who had spoken them at the school debating society.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t count on it,” Guy replied, with a little laugh. “You may get such a
disappointment when you die.” Then in an altered voice, “I don’t want to die. I hate and
fear death. But probably I shan’t be killed after all. All the same .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” His
voice faded out. They stepped into a tunnel of impenetrable darkness between two tall
hornbeam hedges. He had become nothing but a voice, and now that had ceased; he had
disappeared. The voice began again, low, quick, monotonous, a little breathless. “I <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-163">[Pg 163]</a></span>remember once reading
a poem by one of the old Provençal troubadours, telling how God had once granted him
supreme happiness; for the night before he was to set out for the Crusade, it had been
granted him to hold his lady in his arms—all the short eternal night through. Ains que
j’aille oltre mer: when I was going beyond sea.” The voice stopped again. They were
standing at the very mouth of the hornbeam alley, looking out from that close-pent river
of shadow upon an ocean of pale moonlight.</p>

<p>“How still it is.” They did not speak; they hardly breathed. They became saturated with
the quiet.</p>

<p>Marjorie broke the silence. “Do you want me as much as all that, Guy?” All through that
long, speechless minute she had been trying to say the words, repeating them over to
herself, longing to say them aloud, but paralysed, unable to. And at last she had spoken
them, impersonally, as though through the mouth of someone else. She heard them very
distinctly, and was amazed at the matter-of-factness of the tone.</p>

<p>Guy’s answer took the form of a question. <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-164">[Pg 164]</a></span>“Well, suppose I were killed now,” he said, “should I
ever have really lived?”</p>

<p>They had stepped out of the cavernous alley into the moonlight. She could see him
clearly now, and there was something so drooping and dejected and pathetic about him, he
seemed so much of a great, overgrown child that a wave of passionate pitifulness rushed
through her, reinforcing other emotions less maternal. She longed to take him in her arms,
stroke his hair, lullaby him, baby-fashion, to sleep upon her breast. And Guy, on his
side, desired nothing better than to give his fatigues and sensibilities to her maternal
care, to have his eyes kissed fast, and sleep to her soothing. In his relations with
women—but his experience in this direction was deplorably small—he had, unconsciously at
first but afterwards with a realization of what he was doing, played this child part. In
moments of self-analysis he laughed at himself for acting the “child stunt,” as he called
it. Here he was—he hadn’t noticed it yet—doing it again, drooping, dejected, wholly
pathetic, feeble .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>Marjorie was carried away by her emotion. She would give herself to her lover, would
take possession of her helpless, pitiable child. She put her arms round his neck, lifted
her face to his kisses, whispered something tender and inaudible.</p>

<p>Guy drew her towards him and began kissing the soft, warm mouth. He touched the bare
arm that encircled his neck; the flesh was resilient under his fingers; he felt a desire
to pinch it and tear it.</p>

<p>It had been just like this with that little slut Minnie. Just the same—all horrible
lust. He remembered a curious physiological fact out of Havelock Ellis. He shuddered as
though he had touched something disgusting, and pushed her away.</p>

<p>“No, no, no. It’s horrible; it’s odious. Drunk with moonlight and sentimentalizing
about death. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why not just say with Biblical frankness, Lie with me—Lie
with me?”</p>

<p>That this love, which was to have been so marvellous and new and beautiful, should end
libidinously and bestially like the affair, never remembered without a <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-166">[Pg 166]</a></span>shiver of shame, with
Minnie (the vulgarity of her!)—filled him with horror.</p>

<p>Marjorie burst into tears and ran away, wounded and trembling, into the solitude of the
hornbeam shadow. “Go away, go away,” she sobbed, with such intensity of command that Guy,
moved by an immediate remorse and the sight of tears to stop her and ask forgiveness, was
constrained to let her go her ways.</p>

<p>A cool, impersonal calm had succeeded almost immediately to his outburst. Critically,
he examined what he had done, and judged it, not without a certain feeling of
satisfaction, to be the greatest “floater” of his life. But at least the thing was done
and couldn’t be undone. He took the weak-willed man’s delight in the irrevocability of
action. He walked up and down the lawn smoking a cigarette and thinking, clearly and
quietly—remembering the past, questioning the future. When the cigarette was finished he
went into the house.</p>

<p>He entered the smoking-room to hear Roger saying, “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s the poor who
are having the good time now. Plenty to eat, plenty of money, and no taxes to pay. <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-167">[Pg 167]</a></span>No taxes—that’s the
sickening thing. Look at Alfred’s gardener, for instance. He gets twenty-five or thirty
bob a week and an uncommon good house. He’s married, but only has one child. A man like
that is uncommonly well off. He ought to be paying income-tax; he can perfectly well
afford it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Petherton was listening somnolently, Jacobsen with his usual keen, intelligent
politeness; George was playing with the blue Persian kitten.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that George should stay the night, because it was such a bore
having to walk that mile and a bit home again in the dark. Guy took him up to his room and
sat down on the bed for a final cigarette, while George was undressing. It was the hour of
confidence—that rather perilous moment when fatigue has relaxed the fibres of the mind,
making it ready and ripe for sentiment.</p>

<p>“It depresses me so much,” said Guy, “to think that you’re only twenty and that I’m
just on twenty-four. You will be young and sprightly when the war ends; I shall be an old
antique man.”</p>

<p>“Not so old as all that,” George <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-168">[Pg 168]</a></span>answered, pulling off his shirt. His skin was very white,
face, neck, and hands seeming dark brown by comparison; there was a sharply demarcated
high-water mark of sunburn at throat and wrist.</p>

<p>“It horrifies me to think of the time one is wasting in this bloody war, growing
stupider and grosser every day, achieving nothing at all. It will be five, six—God knows
how many—years cut clean out of one’s life. You’ll have the world before you when it’s all
over, but I shall have spent my best time.”</p>

<p>“Of course, it doesn’t make so much difference to me,” said George through a foam of
tooth-brushing; “I’m not capable of doing anything of any particular value. It’s really
all the same whether I lead a blameless life broking stocks or spend my time getting
killed. But for you, I agree, it’s too bloody. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Guy smoked on in silence, his mind filled with a languid resentment against
circumstance. George put on his pyjamas and crept under the sheet; he had to curl himself
up into a ball, because Guy was lying across the end of the bed, and he couldn’t put his
feet down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Guy at last, meditatively—“I suppose the only consolations are, after
all, women and wine. I shall really have to resort to them. Only women are mostly so
fearfully boring and wine is so expensive now.”</p>

<p>“But not all women!” George, it was evident, was waiting to get a confidence off his
chest.</p>

<p>“I gather you’ve found the exceptions.”</p>

<p>George poured forth. He had just spent six months at Chelsea—six dreary months on the
barrack square; but there had been lucid intervals between the drills and the special
courses, which he had filled with many notable voyages of discovery among unknown worlds.
And chiefly, Columbus to his own soul, he had discovered all those psychological
intricacies and potentialities, which only the passions bring to light. <i>Nosce
teipsum</i>, it has been commanded; and a judicious cultivation of the passions is one of
the surest roads to self-knowledge. To George, at barely twenty, it was all so amazingly
new and exciting, and Guy listened to the story of his adventures <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-170">[Pg 170]</a></span>with admiration and a touch of envy. He
regretted the dismal and cloistered chastity—broken only once, and how sordidly! Wouldn’t
he have learnt much more, he wondered—have been a more real and better human being if he
had had George’s experiences? He would have profited by them more than George could ever
hope to do. There was the risk of George’s getting involved in a mere foolish expense of
spirit in a waste of shame. He might not be sufficiently an individual to remain himself
in spite of his surroundings; his hand would be coloured by the dye he worked in. Guy felt
sure that he himself would have run no risk; he would have come, seen, conquered, and
returned intact and still himself, but enriched by the spoils of a new knowledge. Had he
been wrong after all? Had life in the cloister of his own philosophy been wholly
unprofitable?</p>

<p>He looked at George. It was not surprising that the ladies favoured him, glorious
ephebus that he was.</p>

<p>“With a face and figure like mine,” he reflected, “I shouldn’t have been able <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-171">[Pg 171]</a></span>to lead his life, even
if I’d wanted to.” He laughed inwardly.</p>

<p>“You really must meet her,” George was saying enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Guy smiled. “No, I really mustn’t. Let me give you a bit of perfectly good advice.
Never attempt to share your joys with anyone else. People will sympathize with pain, but
not with pleasure. Good night, George.”</p>

<p>He bent over the pillow and kissed the smiling face that was as smooth as a child’s to
his lips.</p>

<p>Guy lay awake for a long time, and his eyes were dry and aching before sleep finally
came upon him. He spent those dark interminable hours thinking—thinking hard, intensely,
painfully. No sooner had he left George’s room than a feeling of intense unhappiness took
hold of him. “Distorted with misery,” that was how he described himself; he loved to coin
such phrases, for he felt the artist’s need to express as well as to feel and think.
Distorted with misery, he went to bed; distorted with misery, he lay and thought and
thought. He had, positively, a sense of physical <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-172">[Pg 172]</a></span>distortion: his guts were twisted, he had a hunched back,
his legs were withered. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>He had the right to be miserable. He was going back to France to-morrow, he had
trampled on his mistress’s love, and he was beginning to doubt himself, to wonder whether
his whole life hadn’t been one ludicrous folly.</p>

<p>He reviewed his life, like a man about to die. Born in another age, he would, he
supposed, have been religious. He had got over religion early, like the measles—at nine a
Low Churchman, at twelve a Broad Churchman, and at fourteen an Agnostic—but he still
retained the temperament of a religious man. Intellectually he was a Voltairian,
emotionally a Bunyanite. To have arrived at this formula was, he felt, a distinct advance
in self-knowledge. And what a fool he had been with Marjorie! The priggishness of his
attitude—making her read Wordsworth when she didn’t want to. Intellectual love—his phrases
weren’t always a blessing; how hopelessly he had deceived himself with words! And now this
evening the <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-173">[Pg
173]</a></span>crowning outrage, when he had behaved to her like a hysterical anchorite
dealing with a temptation. His body tingled, at the recollection, with shame.</p>

<p>An idea occurred to him; he would go and see her, tiptoe downstairs to her room, kneel
by her bed, ask for her forgiveness. He lay quite still imagining the whole scene. He even
went so far as to get out of bed, open the door, which made a noise in the process like a
peacock’s scream, quite unnerving him, and creep to the head of the stairs. He stood there
a long time, his feet growing colder and colder, and then decided that the adventure was
really too sordidly like the episode at the beginning of Tolstoy’s <i>Resurrection</i>.
The door screamed again as he returned; he lay in bed, trying to persuade himself that his
self-control had been admirable and at the same time cursing his absence of courage in not
carrying out what he had intended.</p>

<p>He remembered a lecture he had given Marjorie once on the subject of Sacred and Profane
Love. Poor girl, how had she listened in patience? He <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-174">[Pg 174]</a></span>could see her attending with such a
serious expression on her face that she looked quite ugly. She looked so beautiful when
she was laughing or happy; at the Whites’, for instance, three nights ago, when George and
she had danced after dinner and he had sat, secretly envious, reading a book in the corner
of the room and looking superior. He wouldn’t learn to dance, but always wished he could.
It was a barbarous, aphrodisiacal occupation, he said, and he preferred to spend his time
and energies in reading. Salvationist again! What a much wiser person George had proved
himself than he. He had no prejudices, no theoretical views about the conduct of life; he
just lived, admirably, naturally, as the spirit or the flesh moved him. If only he could
live his life again, if only he could abolish this evening’s monstrous stupidity.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Marjorie also lay awake. She too felt herself distorted with misery. How odiously cruel
he had been, and how much she longed to forgive him! Perhaps he would come in the dark,
when <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-175">[Pg 175]</a></span>all the
house was asleep, tiptoeing into the room very quietly to kneel by her bed and ask to be
forgiven. Would he come, she wondered? She stared into the blackness above her and about
her, willing him to come, commanding him—angry and wretched because he was so slow in
coming, because he didn’t come at all. They were both of them asleep before two.</p>

<p>Seven hours of sleep make a surprising difference to the state of mind. Guy, who
thought he was distorted for life, woke to find himself healthily normal. Marjorie’s
angers and despairs had subsided. The hour they had together between breakfast and Guy’s
departure was filled with almost trivial conversation. Guy was determined to say something
about last’s night incident. But it was only at the very last moment, when the dog-cart
was actually at the door, that he managed to bring out some stammered repentance for what
had happened last night.</p>

<p>“Don’t think about it,” Marjorie had told him. So they had kissed and parted, and their
relations were precisely the <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-176">[Pg
176]</a></span>same as they had been before Guy came on leave.</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>George was sent out a week or two later, and a month after that they heard at Blaybury
that he had lost a leg—fortunately below the knee.</p>

<p>“Poor boy!” said Mr. Petherton. “I must really write a line to his mother at once.”</p>

<p>Jacobsen made no comment, but it was a surprise to him to find how much he had been
moved by the news. George White had lost a leg; he couldn’t get the thought out of his
head. But only below the knee; he might be called lucky. Lucky—things are deplorably
relative, he reflected. One thanks God because He has thought fit to deprive one of His
creatures of a limb.</p>

<p>“Neither delighteth He in any man’s legs,” eh? Nous avons changé tout cela.</p>

<p>George had lost a leg. There would be no more of that Olympian speed and strength and
beauty. Jacobsen conjured up before his memory a vision of the boy running with his great
fawn-coloured <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-177">[Pg
177]</a></span>dog across green expanses of grass. How glorious he had looked, his fine
brown hair blowing like fire in the wind of his own speed, his cheeks flushed, his eyes
very bright. And how easily he ran, with long, bounding strides, looking down at the dog
that jumped and barked at his side!</p>

<p>He had had a perfection, and now it was spoilt. Instead of a leg he had a stump.
<i>Moignon</i>, the French called it; there was the right repulsive sound about
<i>moignon</i> which was lacking in “stump.” Soignons le moignon en l’oignant
d’oignons.</p>

<p>Often, at night before he went to sleep, he couldn’t help thinking of George and the
war and all the millions of <i>moignons</i> there must be in the world. He had a dream one
night of slimy red knobbles, large polyp-like things, growing as he looked at them,
swelling between his hands—<i>moignons</i>, in fact.</p>

<p>George was well enough in the late autumn to come home. He had learnt to hop along on
his crutches very skilfully, and his preposterous donkey-drawn bath-chair soon became a
familiar object in the lanes of the neighbourhood. It <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-178">[Pg 178]</a></span>was a grand sight to behold when George
rattled past at the trot, leaning forward like a young Phœbus in his chariot and urging
his unwilling beast with voice and crutch. He drove over to Blaybury almost every day;
Marjorie and he had endless talks about life and love and Guy and other absorbing topics.
With Jacobsen he played piquet and discussed a thousand subjects. He was always gay and
happy—that was what especially lacerated Jacobsen’s heart with pity.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h4 id="Happily_04">IV</h4>

<p class="noindent">T<small>HE</small> Christmas holidays had begun, and the Reverend
Roger was back again at Blaybury. He was sitting at the writing-table in the drawing-room,
engaged, at the moment, in biting the end of his pen and scratching his head. His face
wore an expression of perplexity; one would have said that he was in the throes of
literary composition. Which indeed he was: “Beloved ward of Alfred Petherton
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he said aloud. “Beloved ward .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He shook his head
doubtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>The door opened and Jacobsen came into the room. Roger turned round at once.</p>

<p>“Have you heard the grievous news?” he said.</p>

<p>“No. What?”</p>

<p>“Poor Guy is dead. We got the telegram half an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” said Jacobsen in an agonized voice which seemed to show that he had been
startled out of the calm belonging to one who leads the life of reason. He had been
conscious ever since George’s mutilation that his defences were growing weaker; external
circumstance was steadily encroaching upon him. Now it had broken in and, for the moment,
he was at its mercy. Guy dead. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He pulled himself together sufficiently to
say, after a pause, “Well, I suppose it was only to be expected sooner or later. Poor
boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s terrible, isn’t it?” said Roger, shaking his head. “I am just writing out an
announcement to send to the <i>Times</i>. One can hardly say ‘the beloved ward of Alfred
Petherton,’ can one? It doesn’t sound quite right; <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-180">[Pg 180]</a></span>and yet one would like somehow to give
public expression to the deep affection Alfred felt for him. ‘Beloved ward’—no, decidedly
it won’t do.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to get round it somehow,” said Jacobsen. Roger’s presence somehow made a
return to the life of reason easier.</p>

<p>“Poor Alfred,” the other went on. “You’ve no idea how hardly he takes it. He feels as
though he had given a son.”</p>

<p>“What a waste it is!” Jacobsen exclaimed. He was altogether too deeply moved.</p>

<p>“I have done my best to console Alfred. One must always bear in mind for what Cause he
died.”</p>

<p>“All those potentialities destroyed. He was an able fellow, was Guy.” Jacobsen was
speaking more to himself than to his companion, but Roger took up the suggestion.</p>

<p>“Yes, he certainly was that. Alfred thought he was very promising. It is for his sake I
am particularly sorry. I never got on very well with the boy myself. He was too eccentric
for my taste. There’s such a thing as being too clever, isn’t there? It’s rather inhuman.
He used to <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-181">[Pg 181]</a></span>do
most remarkable Greek iambics for me when he was a boy. I dare say he was a very good
fellow under all that cleverness and queerness. It’s all very distressing, very
grievous.”</p>

<p>“How was he killed?”</p>

<p>“Died of wounds yesterday morning. Do you think it would be a good thing to put in some
quotation at the end of the announcement in the paper? Something like, ‘Dulce et Decorum,’
or ‘Sed Miles, sed Pro Patria,’ or ‘Per Ardua ad Astra’?”</p>

<p>“It hardly seems essential,” said Jacobsen.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not.” Roger’s lips moved silently; he was counting. “Forty-two words. I
suppose that counts as eight lines. Poor Marjorie! I hope she won’t feel it too bitterly.
Alfred told me they were unofficially engaged.”</p>

<p>“So I gathered.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I shall have to break the news to her. Alfred is too much upset to be able
to do anything himself. It will be a most painful task. Poor girl! I suppose as a matter
of fact they would not have been able to marry for some time, <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-182">[Pg 182]</a></span>as Guy had next to no money. These early
marriages are very rash. Let me see: eight times three shillings is one pound four, isn’t
it? I suppose they take cheques all right?”</p>

<p>“How old was he?” asked Jacobsen.</p>

<p>“Twenty-four and a few months.”</p>

<p>Jacobsen was walking restlessly up and down the room. “Just reaching maturity! One is
thankful these days to have one’s own work and thoughts to take the mind off these
horrors.”</p>

<p>“It’s terrible, isn’t it?—terrible. So many of my pupils have been killed now that I
can hardly keep count of the number.”</p>

<p>There was a tapping at the French window; it was Marjorie asking to be let in. She had
been cutting holly and ivy for the Christmas decorations, and carried a basket full of
dark, shining leaves.</p>

<p>Jacobsen unbolted the big window and Marjorie came in, flushed with the cold and
smiling. Jacobsen had never seen her looking so handsome: she was superb, radiant, like
Iphigenia coming in her wedding garments to the sacrifice.</p>

<p>“The holly is very poor this year,” she <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-183">[Pg 183]</a></span>remarked. “I am afraid we shan’t make much of a show with
our Christmas decorations.”</p>

<p>Jacobsen took the opportunity of slipping out through the French window. Although it
was unpleasantly cold, he walked up and down the flagged paths of the Dutch garden,
hatless and overcoatless, for quite a long time.</p>

<p>Marjorie moved about the drawing-room fixing sprigs of holly round the picture frames.
Her uncle watched her, hesitating to speak; he was feeling enormously uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” he said at last, “that your father’s very upset this morning.” His voice
was husky; he made an explosive noise to clear his throat.</p>

<p>“Is it his palpitations?” Marjorie asked coolly; her father’s infirmities did not cause
her much anxiety.</p>

<p>“No, no.” Roger realized that his opening gambit had been a mistake. “No. It is—er—a
more mental affliction, and one which, I fear, will touch you closely too. Marjorie, you
must be strong and courageous; we have just heard that Guy is dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Guy dead?” She couldn’t believe it; she had hardly envisaged the possibility; besides,
he was on the Staff. “Oh, Uncle Roger, it isn’t true.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid there is no doubt. The War Office telegram came just after you had gone
out for the holly.”</p>

<p>Marjorie sat down on the sofa and hid her face in her hands. Guy dead; she would never
see him again, never see him again, never; she began to cry.</p>

<p>Roger approached and stood, with his hand on her shoulder, in the attitude of a
thought-reader. To those overwhelmed by sorrow the touch of a friendly hand is often
comforting. They have fallen into an abyss, and the touching hand serves to remind them
that life and God and human sympathy still exist, however bottomless the gulf of grief may
seem. On Marjorie’s shoulder her uncle’s hand rested with a damp, heavy warmth that was
peculiarly unpleasant.</p>

<p>“Dear child, it is very grievous, I know; but you must try and be strong and bear it
bravely. We all have our cross to bear. We shall be celebrating the Birth of Christ in two
days’ time; remember <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-185">[Pg
185]</a></span>with what patience He received the cup of agony. And then remember for what
Cause Guy has given his life. He has died a hero’s death, a martyr’s death, witnessing to
Heaven against the powers of evil.” Roger was unconsciously slipping into the words of his
last sermon in the school chapel. “You should feel pride in his death as well as sorrow.
There, there, poor child.” He patted her shoulder two or three times. “Perhaps it would be
kinder to leave you now.”</p>

<p>For some time after her uncle’s departure Marjorie sat motionless in the same position,
her body bent forward, her face in her hands. She kept on repeating the words, “Never
again,” and the sound of them filled her with despair and made her cry. They seemed to
open up such a dreary grey infinite vista—“never again.” They were as a spell evoking
tears.</p>

<p>She got up at last and began walking aimlessly about the room. She paused in front of a
little old black-framed mirror that hung near the window and looked at her reflection in
the glass. She had expected somehow to look different, to have <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-186">[Pg 186]</a></span>changed. She was surprised to find her
face entirely unaltered: grave, melancholy perhaps, but still the same face she had looked
at when she was doing her hair this morning. A curious idea entered her head; she wondered
whether she would be able to smile now, at this dreadful moment. She moved the muscles of
her face and was overwhelmed with shame at the sight of the mirthless grin that mocked her
from the glass. What a beast she was! She burst into tears and threw herself again on the
sofa, burying her face in a cushion. The door opened, and by the noise of shuffling and
tapping Marjorie recognized the approach of George White on his crutches. She did not look
up. At the sight of the abject figure on the sofa, George halted, uncertain what he should
do. Should he quietly go away again, or should he stay and try to say something
comforting? The sight of her lying there gave him almost physical pain. He decided to
stay.</p>

<p>He approached the sofa and stood over her, suspended on his crutches. Still she did not
lift her head, but pressed her <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-187">[Pg
187]</a></span>face deeper into the smothering blindness of the cushion, as though to shut
out from her consciousness all the external world. George looked down at her in silence.
The little delicate tendrils of hair on the nape of her neck were exquisitely
beautiful.</p>

<p>“I was told about it,” he said at last, “just now, as I came in. It’s too awful. I
think I cared for Guy more than for almost anyone in the world. We both did, didn’t
we?”</p>

<p>She began sobbing again. George was overcome with remorse, feeling that he had somehow
hurt her, somehow added to her pain by what he had said. “Poor child, poor child,” he
said, almost aloud. She was a year older than he, but she seemed so helplessly and
pathetically young now that she was crying.</p>

<p>Standing up for long tired him, and he lowered himself, slowly and painfully, into the
sofa beside her. She looked up at last and began drying her eyes.</p>

<p>“I’m so wretched, George, so specially wretched because I feel I didn’t act rightly
towards darling Guy. There were times, you know, when I wondered <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-188">[Pg 188]</a></span>whether it wasn’t all a great mistake,
our being engaged. Sometimes I felt I almost hated him. I’d been feeling so odious about
him these last weeks. And now comes this, and it makes me realize how awful I’ve been
towards him.” She found it a relief to confide and confess; George was so sympathetic, he
would understand. “I’ve been a beast.”</p>

<p>Her voice broke, and it was as though something had broken in George’s head. He was
overwhelmed with pity; he couldn’t bear it that she should suffer.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t distress yourself unnecessarily, Marjorie dear,” he begged her, stroking
the back of her hand with his large hard palm. “Don’t.”</p>

<p>Marjorie went on remorselessly. “When Uncle Roger told me just now, do you know what I
did? I said to myself, Do I really care? I couldn’t make out. I looked in the glass to see
if I could tell from my face. Then I suddenly thought I’d see whether I could laugh, and I
did. And that made me feel how detestable I was, and I started crying again. Oh, I have
been a beast, George, haven’t I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>She burst into a passion of tears and hid her face once more in the friendly cushion.
George couldn’t bear it at all. He laid his hand on her shoulder and bent forward, close
to her, till his face almost touched her hair. “Don’t,” he cried. “Don’t, Marjorie. You
mustn’t torment yourself like this. I know you loved Guy; we both loved him. He would have
wanted us to be happy and brave and to go on with life—not make his death a source of
hopeless despair.” There was a silence, broken only by the agonizing sound of sobbing.
“Marjorie, darling, you mustn’t cry.”</p>

<p>“There, I’m not,” said Marjorie through her tears. “I’ll try to stop. Guy wouldn’t have
wanted us to cry for him. You’re right; he would have wanted us to live for him—worthily,
in his splendid way.”</p>

<p>“We who knew him and loved him must make our lives a memorial of him.” In ordinary
circumstances George would have died rather than make a remark like that. But in speaking
of the dead, people forget themselves and conform to the peculiar obituary convention of
thought <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-190">[Pg 190]</a></span>and
language. Spontaneously, unconsciously, George had conformed.</p>

<p>Marjorie wiped her eyes. “Thank you, George. You know so well what darling Guy would
have liked. You’ve made me feel stronger to bear it. But, all the same, I do feel odious
for what I thought about him sometimes. I didn’t love him enough. And now it’s too late. I
shall never see him again.” The spell of that “never” worked again: Marjorie sobbed
despairingly.</p>

<p>George’s distress knew no bounds. He put his arm round Marjorie’s shoulders and kissed
her hair. “Don’t cry, Marjorie. Everybody feels like that sometimes, even towards the
people they love most. You really mustn’t make yourself miserable.”</p>

<p>Once more she lifted her face and looked at him with a heart-breaking, tearful smile.
“You have been too sweet to me, George. I don’t know what I should have done without
you.”</p>

<p>“Poor darling!” said George. “I can’t bear to see you unhappy.” Their faces were close
to one another, and it seemed natural that at this point <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-191">[Pg 191]</a></span>their lips should meet in a long kiss.
“We’ll remember only the splendid, glorious things about Guy,” he went on—“what a
wonderful person he was, and how much we loved him.” He kissed her again.</p>

<p>“Perhaps our darling Guy is with us here even now,” said Marjorie, with a look of
ecstasy on her face.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he is,” George echoed.</p>

<p>It was at this point that a heavy footstep was heard and a hand rattled at the door.
Marjorie and George moved a little farther apart. The intruder was Roger, who bustled in,
rubbing his hands with an air of conscious heartiness, studiously pretending that nothing
untoward had occurred. It is our English tradition that we should conceal our emotions.
“Well, well,” he said. “I think we had better be going in to luncheon. The bell has
gone.”</p>

ART BY NUMBERS</a></h3>

<p class="noindent">“I <small>HAVE</small> made a discovery,” said Emberlin as I entered
his room.</p>

<p>“What about?” I asked.</p>

<p>“A discovery,” he replied, “about <i>Discoveries</i>.” He radiated an unconcealed
satisfaction; the conversation had evidently gone exactly as he had intended it to go. He
had made his phrase, and, repeating it lovingly—“A discovery about <i>Discoveries</i>”—he
smiled benignly at me, enjoying my look of mystification—an expression which, I confess, I
had purposely exaggerated in order to give him pleasure. For Emberlin, in many ways so
childish, took an especial delight in puzzling and nonplussing his acquaintances; and
these small triumphs, these little “scores” off people afforded him some of his keenest
pleasures. I always indulged his weakness when I <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-193">[Pg 193]</a></span>could, for it was worth while being on Emberlin’s good
books. To be allowed to listen to his post-prandial conversation was a privilege indeed.
Not only was he himself a consummately good talker, but he had also the power of
stimulating others to talk well. He was like some subtle wine, intoxicating just to the
Meredithian level of tipsiness. In his company you would find yourself lifted to the
sphere of nimble and mercurial conceptions; you would suddenly realize that some miracle
had occurred, that you were living no longer in a dull world of jumbled things but
somewhere above the hotch-potch in a glassily perfect universe of ideas, where all was
informed, consistent, symmetrical. And it was Emberlin who, godlike, had the power of
creating this new and real world. He built it out of words, this crystal Eden, where no
belly-going snake, devourer of quotidian dirt, might ever enter and disturb its harmonies.
Since I first knew Emberlin I have come to have a greatly enhanced respect for magic and
all the formules of its liturgy. If by words Emberlin can create a new world <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-194">[Pg 194]</a></span>for me, can make my
spirit slough off completely the domination of the old, why should not he or I or anyone,
having found the suitable phrases, exert by means of them an influence more vulgarly
miraculous upon the world of mere things? Indeed, when I compare Emberlin and the common
or garden black magician of commerce, it seems to me that Emberlin is the greater
thaumaturge. But let that pass; I am straying from my purpose, which was to give some
description of the man who so confidentially whispered to me that he had made a discovery
about <i>Discoveries</i>.</p>

<p>In the best sense of the word, then, Emberlin was academic. For us who knew him his
rooms were an oasis of aloofness planted secretly in the heart of the desert of London. He
exhaled an atmosphere that combined the fantastic speculativeness of the undergraduate
with the more mellowed oddity of incredibly wise and antique dons. He was immensely
erudite, but in a wholly unencyclopædic way—a mine of irrelevant information, as his
enemies said <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-195">[Pg 195]</a></span>of
him. He wrote a certain amount, but, like Mallarmé, avoided publication, deeming it akin
to “the offence of exhibitionism.” Once, however, in the folly of youth, some dozen years
ago, he had published a volume of verses. He spent a good deal of time now in assiduously
collecting copies of his book and burning them. There can be but very few left in the
world now. My friend Cope had the fortune to pick one up the other day—a little blue book,
which he showed me very secretly. I am at a loss to understand why Emberlin wishes to
stamp out all trace of it. There is nothing to be ashamed of in the book; some of the
verses, indeed, are, in their young ecstatic fashion, good. But they are certainly
conceived in a style that is unlike that of his present poems. Perhaps it is that which
makes him so implacable against them. What he writes now for very private manuscript
circulation is curious stuff. I confess I prefer the earlier work; I do not like the
stony, hard-edged quality of this sort of thing—the only one I can remember of his later
productions. It is a sonnet on a porcelain <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-196">[Pg 196]</a></span>figure of a woman, dug up at Cnossus:</p>

<blockquote class="verse">
<p class="i2">“Her eyes of bright unwinking glaze</p>

<p class="i2a">All imperturbable do not</p>

<p class="i2a">Even make pretences to regard</p>

<p class="i2a">The jutting absence of her stays</p>

<p class="i2a">Where many a Syrian gallipot</p>

<p class="i2a">Excites desire with spilth of nard.</p>

<p class="i2a">The bistred rims above the fard</p>

<p class="i2a">Of cheeks as red as bergamot</p>

<p class="i2a">Attest that no shamefaced delays</p>

<p class="i2a">Will clog fulfilment nor retard</p>

<p class="i2a">Full payment of the Cyprian’s praise</p>

<p class="i2a">Down to the last remorseful jot.</p>

<p class="i2a">Hail priestess of we know not what</p>

<p class="i2a">Strange cult of Mycenean days!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">Regrettably, I cannot remember any of Emberlin’s French poems. His
peculiar muse expresses herself better, I think, in that language than in her native
tongue.</p>

<p>Such is Emberlin; such, I should rather say, <i>was</i> he, for, as I propose to show,
he is not now the man that he was when he whispered so confidentially to me, as I entered
the room, that he had made a discovery about <i>Discoveries</i>.</p>

<p>I waited patiently till he had finished his little game of mystification and, when the
moment seemed ripe, I asked him to <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-197">[Pg 197]</a></span>explain himself. Emberlin was ready to open out.</p>

<p>“Well,” he began, “these are the facts—a tedious introduction, I fear, but necessary.
Years ago, when I was first reading Ben Jonson’s <i>Discoveries</i>, that queer jotting of
his, ‘Eupompus gave splendour to Art by Numbers,’ tickled my curiosity. You yourself must
have been struck by the phrase, everybody must have noticed it; and everybody must have
noticed too that no commentator has a word to say on the subject. That is the way of
commentators—the obvious points fulsomely explained and discussed, the hard passages,
about which one might want to know something passed over in the silence of sheer
ignorance. ‘Eupompus gave splendour to Art by Numbers’—the absurd phrase stuck in my head.
At one time it positively haunted me. I used to chant it in my bath, set to music as an
anthem. It went like this, so far as I remember”—and he burst into song: “‘Eupompus,
Eu-u-pompus gave sple-e-e-endour .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.’” and so on, through all the repetitions,
the dragged-out rises and falls of a parodied anthem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>“I sing you this,” he said when he had finished, “just to show you what a hold that
dreadful sentence took upon my mind. For eight years, off and on, its senselessness has
besieged me. I have looked up Eupompus in all the obvious books of reference, of course.
He is there all right—Alexandrian artist, eternized by some wretched little author in some
even wretcheder little anecdote, which at the moment I entirely forget; it had nothing, at
any rate, to do with the embellishment of art by numbers. Long ago I gave up the search as
hopeless; Eupompus remained for me a shadowy figure of mystery, author of some nameless
outrage, bestower of some forgotten benefit upon the art that he practised. His history
seemed wrapt in an impenetrable darkness. And then yesterday I discovered all about him
and his art and his numbers. A chance discovery, than which few things have given me a
greater pleasure.</p>

<p>“I happened upon it, as I say, yesterday when I was glancing through a volume of
Zuylerius. Not, of course, the Zuylerius one knows,” he added quickly, “otherwise <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-199">[Pg 199]</a></span>one would have had the
heart out of Eupompus’ secret years ago.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” I repeated, “not the familiar Zuylerius.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Emberlin, taking seriously my flippancy, “not the familiar John
Zuylerius, Junior, but the elder Henricus Zuylerius, a much less—though perhaps
undeservedly so—renowned figure than his son. But this is not the time to discuss their
respective merits. At any rate, I discovered in a volume of critical dialogues by the
elder Zuylerius, the reference, to which, without doubt, Jonson was referring in his note.
(It was of course a mere jotting, never meant to be printed, but which Jonson’s literary
executors pitched into the book with all the rest of the available posthumous materials.)
‘Eupompus gave splendour to Art by Numbers’—Zuylerius gives a very circumstantial account
of the process. He must, I suppose, have found the sources for it in some writer now lost
to us.”</p>

<p>Emberlin paused a moment to muse. The loss of the work of any ancient writer gave him
the keenest sorrow. I rather <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-200">[Pg
200]</a></span>believe he had written a version of the unrecovered books of Petronius.
Some day I hope I shall be permitted to see what conception Emberlin has of the
<i>Satyricon</i> as a whole. He would, I am sure, do Petronius justice—almost too much,
perhaps.</p>

<p>“What was the story of Eupompus?” I asked. “I am all curiosity to know.”</p>

<p>Emberlin heaved a sigh and went on.</p>

<p>“Zuylerius’ narrative,” he said, “is very bald, but on the whole lucid; and I think it
gives one the main points of the story. I will give it you in my own words; that is
preferable to reading his Dutch Latin. Eupompus, then, was one of the most fashionable
portrait-painters of Alexandria. His clientele was large, his business immensely
profitable. For a half-length in oils the great courtesans would pay him a month’s
earnings. He would paint likenesses of the merchant princes in exchange for the costliest
of their outlandish treasures. Coal-black potentates would come a thousand miles out of
Ethiopia to have a miniature limned on some specially choice panel of ivory; and for
payment there would be camel-loads <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-201">[Pg 201]</a></span>of gold and spices. Fame, riches, and honour came to him
while he was yet young; an unparalleled career seemed to lie before him. And then, quite
suddenly, he gave it all up—refused to paint another portrait. The doors of his studio
were closed. It was in vain that clients, however rich, however distinguished, demanded
admission; the slaves had their order; Eupompus would see no one but his own
intimates.”</p>

<p>Emberlin made a pause in his narrative.</p>

<p>“What was Eupompus doing?” I asked.</p>

<p>“He was, of course,” said Emberlin, “occupied in giving splendour to Art by Numbers.
And this, as far as I can gather from Zuylerius, is how it all happened. He just suddenly
fell in love with numbers—head over ears, amorous of pure counting. Number seemed to him
to be the sole reality, the only thing about which the mind of man could be certain. To
count was the one thing worth doing, because it was the one thing you could be sure of
doing right. Thus, art, that it may have any value at all, must ally itself with
reality—must, <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-202">[Pg
202]</a></span>that is, possess a numerical foundation. He carried the idea into practice
by painting the first picture in his new style. It was a gigantic canvas, covering several
hundred square feet—I have no doubt that Eupompus could have told you the exact area to an
inch—and upon it was represented an illimitable ocean covered, as far as the eye could
reach in every direction, with a multitude of black swans. There were thirty-three
thousand of these black swans, each, even though it might be but a speck on the horizon,
distinctly limned. In the middle of the ocean was an island, upon which stood a more or
less human figure having three eyes, three arms and legs, three breasts and three navels.
In the leaden sky three suns were dimly expiring. There was nothing more in the picture;
Zuylerius describes it exactly. Eupompus spent nine months of hard work in painting it.
The privileged few who were allowed to see it pronounced it, finished, a masterpiece. They
gathered round Eupompus in a little school, calling themselves the Philarithmics. They
would sit for hours in <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-203">[Pg
203]</a></span>front of his great work, contemplating the swans and counting them;
according to the Philarithmics, to count and to contemplate were the same thing.</p>

<p>“Eupompus’ next picture, representing an orchard of identical trees set in quincunxes,
was regarded with less favour by the connoisseurs. His studies of crowds were, however,
more highly esteemed; in these were portrayed masses of people arranged in groups that
exactly imitated the number and position of the stars making up various of the more famous
constellations. And then there was his famous picture of the amphitheatre, which created a
furore among the Philarithmics. Zuylerius again gives us a detailed description. Tier upon
tier of seats are seen, all occupied by strange Cyclopean figures. Each tier accommodates
more people than the tier below, and the number rises in a complicated but regular
progression. All the figures seated in the amphitheatre possess but a single eye, enormous
and luminous, planted in the middle of the forehead: and all these thousands of single
eyes are fixed, in a <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-204">[Pg
204]</a></span>terrible and menacing scrutiny, upon a dwarf-like creature cowering
pitiably in the arena. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He alone of the multitude possesses two eyes.</p>

<p>“I would give anything to see that picture,” Emberlin added, after a pause. “The
colouring, you know; Zuylerius gives no hint, but I feel somehow certain that the dominant
tone must have been a fierce brick-red—a red granite amphitheatre filled with a red-robed
assembly, sharply defined against an implacable blue sky.”</p>

<p>“Their eyes would be green,” I suggested.</p>

<p>Emberlin closed his eyes to visualize the scene and then nodded a slow and rather
dubious assent.</p>

<p>“Up to this point,” Emberlin resumed at length, “Zuylerius’ account is very clear. But
his descriptions of the later philarithmic art become extremely obscure; I doubt whether
he understood in the least what it was all about. I will give you such meaning as I manage
to extract from his chaos. Eupompus seems to have grown tired of painting merely numbers
of objects. He wanted <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-205">[Pg
205]</a></span>now to represent Number itself. And then he conceived the plan of rendering
visible the fundamental ideas of life through the medium of those purely numerical terms
into which, according to him, they must ultimately resolve themselves. Zuylerius speaks
vaguely of a picture of Eros, which seems to have consisted of a series of interlacing
planes. Eupompus’ fancy seems next to have been taken by various of the Socratic dialogues
upon the nature of general ideas, and he made a series of illustrations for them in the
same arithmo-geometric style. Finally there is Zuylerius’ wild description of the last
picture that Eupompus ever painted. I can make very little of it. The subject of the work,
at least, is clearly stated; it was a representation of Pure Number, or God and the
Universe, or whatever you like to call that pleasingly inane conception of totality. It
was a picture of the cosmos seen, I take it, through a rather Neoplatonic <i>camera
obscura—</i>very clear and in small. Zuylerius suggests a design of planes radiating out
from a single point of light. I dare <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-206">[Pg 206]</a></span>say something of the kind came in. Actually, I have no
doubt, the work was a very adequate rendering in visible form of the conception of the one
and the many, with all the intermediate stages of enlightenment between matter and the
<i>Fons Deitatis</i>. However, it’s no use speculating what the picture may have been
going to look like. Poor old Eupompus went mad before he had completely finished it and,
after he had dispatched two of the admiring Philarithmics with a hammer, he flung himself
out of the window and broke his neck. That was the end of him, and that was how he gave
splendour, regrettably transient, to Art by Numbers.”</p>

<p>Emberlin stopped. We brooded over our pipes in silence; poor old Eupompus!</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>That was four months ago, and to-day Emberlin is a confirmed and apparently
irreclaimable Philarithmic, a quite whole-hearted Eupompian.</p>

<p>It was always Emberlin’s way to take up the ideas that he finds in books and to put
them into practice. He was once, <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"

considerable proficiency in the Great Art. He studied mnemonics under Bruno and Raymond
Lully, and constructed for himself a model of the latter’s syllogizing machine, in hopes
of gaining that universal knowledge which the Enlightened Doctor guaranteed to its user.
This time it is Eupompianism, and the thing has taken hold of him. I have held up to him
all the hideous warnings that I can find in history. But it is no use.</p>

<p>There is the pitiable spectacle of Dr. Johnson under the tyranny of an Eupompian
ritual, counting the posts and the paving-stones of Fleet Street. He himself knew best how
nearly a madman he was.</p>

<p>And then I count as Eupompians all gamblers, all calculating boys, all interpreters of
the prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse; then too the Elberfeld horses, most complete
of all Eupompians.</p>

<p>And here was Emberlin joining himself to this sect, degrading himself to the level of
counting beasts and irrational children and men, more or less insane. <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-208">[Pg 208]</a></span>Dr. Johnson was at
least born with a strain of the Eupompian aberration in him; Emberlin is busily and
consciously acquiring it. My expostulations, the expostulations of all his friends, are as
yet unavailing. It is in vain that I tell Emberlin that counting is the easiest thing in
the world to do, that when I am utterly exhausted, my brain, for lack of ability to
perform any other work, just counts and reckons, like a machine, like an Elberfeld horse.
It all falls on deaf ears; Emberlin merely smiles and shows me some new numerical joke
that he has discovered. Emberlin can never enter a tiled bathroom now without counting how
many courses of tiles there are from floor to ceiling. He regards it as an interesting
fact that there are twenty-six rows of tiles in his bathroom and thirty-two in mine, while
all the public lavatories in Holborn have the same number. He knows now how many paces it
is from any one point in London to any other. I have given up going for walks with him. I
am always made so distressingly conscious by his preoccupied look, that he is counting his
steps.</p>

<p>His evenings, too, have become profoundly <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-209">[Pg 209]</a></span>melancholy; the conversation, however well it may begin,
always comes round to the same nauseating subject. We can never escape numbers; Eupompus
haunts us. It is not as if we were mathematicians and could discuss problems of any
interest or value. No, none of us are mathematicians, least of all Emberlin. Emberlin
likes talking about such points as the numerical significance of the Trinity, the immense
importance of its being three in one, not forgetting the even greater importance of its
being one in three. He likes giving us statistics about the speed of light or the rate of
growth in fingernails. He loves to speculate on the nature of odd and even numbers. And he
seems to be unconscious how much he has changed for the worse. He is happy in an
exclusively absorbing interest. It is as though some mental leprosy had fallen upon his
intelligence.</p>

<p>In another year or so, I tell Emberlin, he may almost be able to compete with the
calculating horses on their own ground. He will have lost all traces of his reason, but he
will be able to extract cube roots in his head. It occurs to me that the <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-210">[Pg 210]</a></span>reason why Eupompus
killed himself was not that he was mad; on the contrary, it was because he was,
temporarily, sane. He had been mad for years, and then suddenly the idiot’s
self-complacency was lit up by a flash of sanity. By its momentary light he saw into what
gulfs of imbecility he had plunged. He saw and understood, and the full horror, the
lamentable absurdity of the situation made him desperate. He vindicated Eupompus against
Eupompianism, humanity against the Philarithmics. It gives me the greatest pleasure to
think that he disposed of two of that hideous crew before he died himself.</p>

FAMILIES</a></h3>

<p class="noindent">T<small>HE</small> scene is a conservatory. Luxuriant tropical plants
are seen looming through a greenish aquarium twilight, punctuated here and there by the
surprising pink of several Chinese lanterns hanging from the roof or on the branches of
trees, while a warm yellow radiance streams out from the ball-room by a door on the left
of the scene. Through the glass of the conservatory, at the back of the stage, one
perceives a black-and-white landscape under the moon—expanses of snow, lined and dotted
with coal-black hedges and trees. Outside is frost and death: but within the conservatory
all is palpitating and steaming with tropical life and heat. Enormous fantastic plants
encumber it; trees, creepers that writhe with serpentine life, orchids of every kind.
Everywhere dense vegetation; horrible flowers that look like bottled spiders, like
suppurating wounds; <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-212">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;[Pg 212]</a></span>flowers with eyes
and tongues, with moving, sensitive tentacles, with breasts and teeth and spotted
skins.</p>

<p>The strains of a waltz float in through the ball-room door, and to that slow, soft
music there enter, in parallel processions, the two families which are respectively Mr.
Aston J. Tyrrell and Miss Topsy Garrick.</p>

<p>The doyen of the Tyrrell family is a young and perhaps too cultured literary man with
rather long, dark brown hair, a face well cut and sensitive, if a trifle weak about the
lower jaw, and a voice whose exquisite modulations could only be the product of education
at one of the two Great Universities. We will call him plain Aston. Miss Topsy, the head
of the Garrick family, is a young woman of not quite twenty, with sleek, yellow hair
hanging, like a page’s, short and thick about her ears; boyish, too, in her slenderness
and length of leg—boyish, but feminine and attractive to the last degree. Miss Topsy
paints charmingly, sings in a small, pure voice that twists the heart and makes the bowels
yearn in the hearing of it, is well educated, and has read, or at <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-213">[Pg 213]</a></span>least heard of, most of the best books in
three languages, knows something, too, of economics and the doctrines of Freud.</p>

<p>They enter arm in arm, fresh from the dance, trailing behind them with their disengaged
hands two absurd ventriloquist’s dummies of themselves. They sit down on a bench placed in
the middle of the stage under a kind of arbour festooned with fabulous flowers. The other
members of the two families lurk in the tropical twilight of the background.</p>

<p>Aston advances his dummy and makes it speak, moving its mouth and limbs appropriately
by means of the secret levers which his hand controls.</p>

<p class="dialogue">This purple one with eyes is the assafœtida flower. Don’t put your
nose too near; it has a smell like burning flesh. <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-230">[Pg 230]</a></span>This is a Cypripedium from Sumatra. It is the only
man-eating flower in the world. Notice its double set of teeth. (<i>He puts a stick into
the mouth of the flower, which instantly snaps to, like a steel trap.</i>) Nasty, vicious
brute! These blossoms like purple sponges belong to the twangum tree; when you squeeze
them they ooze blood. This is the Jonesia, the octopus of the floral world: each of its
eight tentacles is armed with a sting capable of killing a horse. Now this is a most
interesting and instructive flower—the patchouli bloom. It is perhaps the most striking
example in nature of structural specialization brought about by Evolution. If only Darwin
had lived to see the patchouli plant! You have heard of flowers specially adapting
themselves to be fertilized by bees or butterflies or spiders and such-like? Well, this
plant which grows in the forests of Guatemala can only be fertilized by English explorers.
Observe the structure of the flower; at the base is a flat, projecting pan, containing the
pistil; above it an overarching tube ending in a spout. On either side a small crevice
about three-quarters <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-231">[Pg
231]</a></span>of an inch in length may be discerned in the fleshy lobes of the calix. The
English traveller seeing this plant is immediately struck by its resemblance to those
penny-in-the-slot machines which provide scent for the public in the railway stations at
home. Through sheer force of habit he takes a penny from his pocket and inserts it in one
of the crevices or slots. Immediate result—a jet of highly scented liquid pollen is
discharged from the spout upon the pistil lying below, and the plant is fertilized. Could
anything be more miraculous? And yet there are those who deny the existence of God. Poor
fools!</p>

<p class="noindent">W<small>HEN</small>, some fifty years hence, my grandchildren ask me
what I did when I was at Oxford in the remote days towards the beginning of our monstrous
century, I shall look back across the widening gulf of time and tell them with perfect
good faith that I never worked less than eight hours a day, that I took a keen interest in
Social Service, and that coffee was the strongest stimulant in which I indulged. And they
will very justly say—but I hope I shall be out of hearing. That is why I propose to write
my memoirs as soon as possible, before I have had time to forget, so that having the truth
before me I shall never in time to come be able, consciously or unconsciously, to tell
lies about myself.</p>

<p>At present I have no time to write a complete account of that decisive period in my
history. I must content myself <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-246">[Pg
246]</a></span>therefore with describing a single incident of my undergraduate days. I
have selected this one because it is curious and at the same time wholly characteristic of
Oxford life before the war.</p>

<p>My friend Lykeham was an Exhibitioner at Swellfoot College. He combined blood (he was
immensely proud of his Anglo-Saxon descent and the derivation of his name from Old English
<i>lycam</i>, a corpse) with brains. His tastes were eccentric, his habits deplorable, the
range of his information immense. As he is now dead, I will say no more about his
character.</p>

<p>To proceed with my anecdote: I had gone one evening, as was my custom, to visit him in
his rooms at Swellfoot. It was just after nine when I mounted the stairs, and great Tom
was still tolling.</p>

<blockquote class="verse">
<p class="i3">“In Thomae laude</p>

<p class="i3a">Resono bim bam sine fraude,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">as the charmingly imbecile motto used to run, and to-night he was
living up to it by bim-bamming away in a persistent <i>basso profondo</i> that made an
astonishing background of discord to the sound of <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-247">[Pg 247]</a></span>frantic guitar playing which emanated from Lykeham’s
room. From the fury of his twanging I could tell that something more than usually
cataclysmic had happened, for mercifully it was only in moments of the greatest stress
that Lykeham touched his guitar.</p>

<p>I entered the room with my hands over my ears. “For God’s sake——” I implored. Through
the open window Tom was shouting a deep E flat, with a spread chord of under- and
over-tones, while the guitar gibbered shrilly and hysterically in D natural. Lykeham
laughed, banged down his guitar on to the sofa with such violence that it gave forth a
trembling groan from all its strings, and ran forward to meet me. He slapped me on the
shoulder with painful heartiness; his whole face radiated joy and excitement.</p>

<p>I can sympathize with people’s pains, but not with their pleasures. There is something
curiously boring about somebody else’s happiness.</p>

<p>“You are perspiring,” I said coldly.</p>

<p>Lykeham mopped himself, but went grinning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, what is it this time?” I asked. “Are you engaged to be married again?”</p>

<p>Lykeham burst forth with the triumphant pleasure of one who has at last found an
opportunity of disburdening himself of an oppressive secret. “Far better than that,” he
cried.</p>

<p>I groaned. “Some more than usually unpleasant amour, I suppose.” I knew that he had
been in London the day before, a pressing engagement with the dentist having furnished an
excuse to stay the night.</p>

<p>“Don’t be gross,” said Lykeham, with a nervous laugh which showed that my suspicions
had been only too well founded.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s hear about the delectable Flossie or Effie or whatever her name was,” I
said, with resignation.</p>

<p>“I tell you she was a goddess.”</p>

<p>“The goddess of reason, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“A goddess,” Lykeham continued; “the most wonderful creature I’ve ever seen. And the
extraordinary thing is,” he added confidentially, and with ill-suppressed pride, “that it
seems I myself am a god of sorts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of gardens; but do come down to facts.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you the whole story. It was like this: Last night I was in town, you know,
and went to see that capital play that’s running at the Prince Consort’s. It’s one of
those ingenious combinations of melodrama and problem play, which thrill you to the marrow
and at the same time give you a virtuous feeling that you’ve been to see something
serious. Well, I rolled in rather late, having secured an admirable place in the front row
of the dress circle. I trampled in over the populace, and casually observed that there was
a girl sitting next me, whom I apologized to for treading on her toes. I thought no more
about her during the first act. In the interval, when the lights were on again, I turned
round to look at things in general and discovered that there was a goddess sitting next
me. One only had to look at her to see she was a goddess. She was quite incredibly
beautiful—rather pale and virginal and slim, and at the same time very stately. I can’t
describe her; she was simply perfect—there’s nothing more to be said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perfect,” I repeated, “but so were all the rest.”</p>

<p>“Fool!” Lykeham answered impatiently. “All the rest were just damned women. This was a
goddess, I tell you. Don’t interrupt me any more. As I was looking with astonishment at
her profile, she turned her head and looked squarely at me. I’ve never seen anything so
lovely; I almost swooned away. Our eyes met——”</p>

<p>“What an awful novelist’s expression!” I expostulated.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it; there’s no other word. Our eyes did meet, and we both fell
simultaneously in love.”</p>

<p>“Speak for yourself.”</p>

<p>“I could see it in her eyes. Well, to go on. We looked at one another several times
during that first interval, and then the second act began. In the course of the act,
entirely accidentally, I knocked my programme on to the floor, and reaching down to get it
I touched her hand. Well, there was obviously nothing else to do but to take hold of
it.”</p>

<p>“And what did she do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing. We sat like that the whole of the rest of the act, rapturously happy
and——”</p>

<p>“And quietly perspiring palm to palm. I know exactly, so we can pass over that.
Proceed.”</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t know in the least; you’ve never held a goddess’s hand. When the
lights went up again I reluctantly dropped her hand, not liking the thought of the profane
crowd seeing us, and for want of anything better to say, I asked her if she actually was a
goddess. She said it was a curious question, as she’d been wondering what god I was. So we
said, how incredible: and I said I was sure she was a goddess, and she said she was
certain I was a god, and I bought some chocolates, and the third act began. Now, it being
a melodrama, there was of course in the third act a murder and burglary scene, in which
all the lights were turned out. In this thrilling moment of total blackness I suddenly
felt her kiss me on the cheek.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said she was virginal.”</p>

<p>“So she was—absolutely, frozenly <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-252">[Pg 252]</a></span>virginal; but she was made of a sort of burning ice, if
you understand me. She was virginally passionate—just the combination you’d expect to find
in a goddess. I admit I was startled when she kissed me, but with infinite presence of
mind I kissed her back, on the mouth. Then the murder was finished and the lights went on
again. Nothing much more happened till the end of the show, when I helped her on with her
coat and we went out together, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world, and got
into a taxi. I told the man to drive somewhere where we could get supper, and he drove
there.”</p>

<p>“Not without embracements by the way?”</p>

<p>“No, not without certain embracements.”</p>

<p>“Always passionately virginal?”</p>

<p>“Always virginally passionate.”</p>

<p>“Proceed.”</p>

<p>“Well, we had supper—a positively Olympian affair, nectar and ambrosia and stolen
hand-pressures. She became more and more wonderful every moment. My God, you should have
seen her eyes! <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-253">[Pg
253]</a></span>The whole soul seemed to burn in their depths, like fire under the
sea——”</p>

<p>“For narrative,” I interrupted him, “the epic or heroic style is altogether more
suitable than the lyrical.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I say, we had supper, and after that my memory becomes a sort of burning
mist.”</p>

<p>“Let us make haste to draw the inevitable veil. What was her name?”</p>

<p>Lykeham confessed that he didn’t know; as she was a goddess, it didn’t really seem to
matter what her earthly name was. How did he expect to find her again? He hadn’t thought
of that, but knew she’d turn up somehow. I told him he was a fool, and asked which
particular goddess he thought she was and which particular god he himself.</p>

<p>“We discussed that,” he said. “We first thought Ares and Aphrodite; but she wasn’t my
idea of Aphrodite, and I don’t know that I’m very much like Ares.”</p>

<p>He looked pensively in the old Venetian mirror which hung over the fireplace. It was a
complacent look, for Lykeham was rather vain about his personal appearance, <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-254">[Pg 254]</a></span>which was, indeed,
repulsive at first sight, but had, when you looked again, a certain strange and
fascinating ugly beauty. Bearded, he would have made a passable Socrates. But Ares—no,
certainly he wasn’t Ares.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re Hephæstus,” I suggested; but the idea was received coldly.</p>

<p>Was he sure that she was a goddess? Mightn’t she just have been a nymph of sorts?
Europa, for instance. Lykeham repudiated the implied suggestion that he was a bull, nor
would he hear of himself as a swan or a shower of gold. It was possible, however, he
thought, that he was Apollo and she Daphne, reincarnated from her vegetable state. And
though I laughed heartily at the idea of his being Phœbus Apollo, Lykeham stuck to the
theory with increasing obstinacy. The more he thought of it the more it seemed to him
probable that his nymph, with her burning cold virginal passion, was Daphne, while to
doubt that he himself was Apollo seemed hardly to occur to him.</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was about a fortnight later, in June, <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-255">[Pg 255]</a></span>towards the end of term, that we discovered Lykeham’s
Olympian identity. We had gone, Lykeham and I, for an after-dinner walk. We set out
through the pale tranquillity of twilight, and following the towpath up the river as far
as Godstow, halted at the inn for a glass of port and a talk with the glorious old female
Falstaff in black silk who kept it. We were royally entertained with gossip and old wine,
and after Lykeham had sung a comic song which had reduced the old lady to a quivering
jelly of hysterical laughter, we set out once more, intending to go yet a little farther
up the river before we turned back. Darkness had fallen by this time; the stars were
lighted in the sky; it was the sort of summer night to which Marlowe compared Helen of
Troy. Over the meadows invisible peewits wheeled and uttered their melancholy cry; the
far-off thunder of the weir bore a continuous, even burden to all the other small noises
of the night. Lykeham and I walked on in silence. We had covered perhaps a quarter of a
mile when all at once my companion stopped and began <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-256">[Pg 256]</a></span>looking fixedly westward towards Witham
Hill. I paused too, and saw that he was staring at the thin crescent of the moon, which
was preparing to set in the dark woods that crowned the eminence.</p>

<p>“What are you looking at?” I asked.</p>

<p>But Lykeham paid no attention, only muttered something to himself. Then suddenly he
cried out, “It’s she!” and started off at full gallop across the fields in the direction
of the hill. Conceiving that he had gone suddenly mad, I followed. We crashed through the
first hedge twenty yards apart. Then came the backwater; Lykeham leapt, flopped in
three-quarters of the way across, and scrambled oozily ashore. I made a better jump and
landed among the mud and rushes of the farther bank. Two more hedges and a ploughed field,
a hedge, a road, a gate, another field, and then we were in Witham Wood itself. It was
pitch black under the trees, and Lykeham had perforce to slacken his pace a little. I
followed him by the noise he made crashing through the undergrowth and cursing when he
hurt himself. That <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-257">[Pg
257]</a></span>wood was a nightmare, but we got through it somehow and into the open glade
at the top of the hill. Through the trees on the farther side of the clearing shone the
moon, seeming incredibly close at hand. Then, suddenly, along the very path of the
moonlight, the figure of a woman came walking through the trees into the open. Lykeham
rushed towards her and flung himself at her feet and embraced her knees; she stooped down
and smoothed his ruffled hair. I turned and walked away; it is not for a mere mortal to
look on at the embracements of the gods.</p>

<p>As I walked back, I wondered who on earth—or rather who in heaven—Lykeham could be. For
here was chaste Cynthia giving herself to him in the most unequivocal fashion. Could he be
Endymion? No, the idea was too preposterous to be entertained for a moment. But I could
think of no other loved by the virgin moon. Yet surely I seemed dimly to recollect that
there had been some favoured god; for the life of me I could not remember who. All the way
back along the river path I searched <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-258">[Pg 258]</a></span>my mind for his name, and always it eluded me.</p>

<p>But on my return I looked up the matter in Lemprière, and almost died of laughing when
I discovered the truth. I thought of Lykeham’s Venetian mirror and his complacent side
glances at his own image, and his belief that he was Apollo, and I laughed and laughed.
And when, considerably after midnight, Lykeham got back to college, I met him in the porch
and took him quietly by the sleeve, and in his ear I whispered,
“G<small>OAT</small>-F<small>OOT</small>,” and then I roared with laughter once again.</p>

<h3 class="no_sections" id="Bookshop"><a href="#Bookshop_toc">THE BOOKSHOP</a></h3>

<p class="noindent">I<small>T</small> seemed indeed an unlikely place to find a bookshop.
All the other commercial enterprises of the street aimed at purveying the barest
necessities to the busy squalor of the quarter. In this, the main arterial street, there
was a specious glitter and life produced by the swift passage of the traffic. It was
almost airy, almost gay. But all around great tracts of slum pullulated dankly. The
inhabitants did their shopping in the grand street; they passed, holding gobbets of meat
that showed glutinous even through the wrappings of paper; they cheapened linoleum at
upholstery doors; women, black-bonneted and black-shawled, went shuffling to their
marketing with dilapidated bags of straw plait. How should these, I wondered, buy books?
And yet there it was, a tiny shop; and the windows were fitted with shelves, and there
were the brown backs of books. <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-260">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;[Pg 260]</a></span>To the right a
large emporium overflowed into the street with its fabulously cheap furniture; to the left
the curtained, discreet windows of an eating-house announced in chipped white letters the
merits of sixpenny dinners. Between, so narrow as scarcely to prevent the junction of food
and furniture, was the little shop. A door and four feet of dark window, that was the full
extent of frontage. One saw here that literature was a luxury; it took its proportionable
room here in this place of necessity. Still, the comfort was that it survived, definitely
survived.</p>

<p>The owner of the shop was standing in the doorway, a little man, grizzle-bearded and
with eyes very active round the corners of the spectacles that bridged his long, sharp
nose.</p>

<p>“Trade is good?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Better in my grandfather’s day,” he told me, shaking his head sadly.</p>

<p>“We grow progressively more Philistine,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“It is our cheap press. The ephemeral overwhelms the permanent, the classical.”</p>

<p>“This journalism,” I agreed, “or call <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-261">[Pg 261]</a></span>it rather this piddling quotidianism, is the curse of our
age.”</p>

<p>“Fit only for——” He gesticulated clutchingly with his hands as though seeking the
word.</p>

<p>“For the fire.”</p>

<p>The old man was triumphantly emphatic with his, “No: for the sewer.”</p>

<p>I laughed sympathetically at his passion. “We are delightfully at one in our views,” I
told him. “May I look about me a little among your treasures?”</p>

<p>Within the shop was a brown twilight, redolent with old leather and the smell of that
fine subtle dust that clings to the pages of forgotten books, as though preservative of
their secrets—like the dry sand of Asian deserts beneath which, still incredibly intact,
lie the treasures and the rubbish of a thousand years ago. I opened the first volume that
came to my hand. It was a book of fashion-plates, tinted elaborately by hand in magenta
and purple, maroon and solferino and puce and those melting shades of green that a yet
earlier generation had called “the sorrows of Werther.” Beauties in crinolines swam with
the amplitude <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-262">[Pg 262]</a></span>of
pavilioned ships across the pages. Their feet were represented as thin and flat and black,
like tea-leaves shyly protruding from under their petticoats. Their faces were egg-shaped,
sleeked round with hair of glossy black, and expressive of an immaculate purity. I thought
of our modern fashion figures, with their heels and their arch of instep, their flattened
faces and smile of pouting invitation. It was difficult not to be a deteriorationist. I am
easily moved by symbols; there is something of a Quarles in my nature. Lacking the
philosophic mind, I prefer to see my abstractions concretely imaged. And it occurred to me
then that if I wanted an emblem to picture the sacredness of marriage and the influence of
the home I could not do better than choose two little black feet like tea-leaves peeping
out decorously from under the hem of wide, disguising petticoats. While heels and
thoroughbred insteps should figure—oh well, the reverse.</p>

<p>The current of my thoughts was turned aside by the old man’s voice. “I expect you are
musical,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh yes, I was a little; and he held out to me a bulky folio.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear this?” he asked.</p>

<p><i>Robert the Devil</i>: no, I never had. I did not doubt that it was a gap in my
musical education.</p>

<p>The old man took the book and drew up a chair from the dim <i>penetralia</i> of the
shop. It was then that I noticed a surprising fact: what I had, at a careless glance,
taken to be a common counter I perceived now to be a piano of a square, unfamiliar shape.
The old man sat down before it. “You must forgive any defects in its tone,” he said,
turning to me. “An early Broadwood, Georgian, you know, and has seen a deal of service in
a hundred years.”</p>

<p>He opened the lid, and the yellow keys grinned at me in the darkness like the teeth of
an ancient horse.</p>

<p>The old man rustled pages till he found a desired place. “The ballet music,” he said:
“it’s fine. Listen to this.”</p>

<p>His bony, rather tremulous hands began suddenly to move with an astonishing nimbleness,
and there rose up, faint <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-264">[Pg
264]</a></span>and tinkling against the roar of the traffic, a gay pirouetting music. The
instrument rattled considerably and the volume of sound was thin as the trickle of a
drought-shrunken stream: but, still, it kept tune and the melody was there, filmy,
aerial.</p>

<p>“And now for the drinking-song,” cried the old man, warming excitedly to his work. He
played a series of chords that mounted modulating upwards towards a breaking-point; so
supremely operatic as positively to be a parody of that moment of tautening suspense, when
the singers are bracing themselves for a burst of passion. And then it came, the drinking
chorus. One pictured to oneself cloaked men, wildly jovial over the emptiness of cardboard
flagons.</p>

<blockquote class="verse">
<p class="i3">“Versiam’ a tazza piena</p>

<p class="i3a">Il generoso umor .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">The old man’s voice was cracked and shrill, but his enthusiasm made up
for any defects in execution. I had never seen anyone so wholeheartedly a reveller.</p>

<p>He turned over a few more pages. “Ah, the ‘Valse Infernale,’” he said. <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-265">[Pg 265]</a></span>“That’s good.” There
was a little melancholy prelude and then the tune, not so infernal perhaps as one might
have been led to expect, but still pleasant enough. I looked over his shoulder at the
words and sang to his accompaniment.</p>

<blockquote class="verse">
<p class="i3">“Demoni fatali</p>

<p class="i3a">Fantasmi d’orror,</p>

<p class="i3a">Dei regni infernali</p>

<p class="i3a">Plaudite al signor.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">A great steam-driven brewer’s lorry roared past with its annihilating
thunder and utterly blotted out the last line. The old man’s hands still moved over the
yellow keys, my mouth opened and shut; but there was no sound of words or music. It was as
though the fatal demons, the phantasms of horror, had made a sudden irruption into this
peaceful, abstracted place.</p>

<p>I looked out through the narrow door. The traffic ceaselessly passed; men and women
hurried along with set faces. Phantasms of horror, all of them: infernal realms wherein
they dwelt. Outside, men lived under the tyranny of things. Their every action was
determined <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-266">[Pg 266]</a></span>by
the orders of mere matter, by money, and the tools of their trade and the unthinking laws
of habit and convention. But here I seemed to be safe from things, living at a remove from
actuality; here where a bearded old man, improbable survival from some other time,
indomitably played the music of romance, despite the fact that the phantasms of horror
might occasionally drown the sound of it with their clamour.</p>

<p>“So: will you take it?” The voice of the old man broke across my thoughts. “I will let
you have it for five shillings.” He was holding out the thick, dilapidated volume towards
me. His face wore a look of strained anxiety. I could see how eager he was to get my five
shillings, how necessary, poor man! for him. He has been, I thought with an unreasonable
bitterness—he has been simply performing for my benefit, like a trained dog. His
aloofness, his culture—all a business trick. I felt aggrieved. He was just one of the
common phantasms of horror masquerading as the angel of this somewhat comic paradise of
contemplation. I gave him a couple of <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-267">[Pg 267]</a></span>half-crowns and he began wrapping the book in paper.</p>

<p>“I tell you,” he said, “I’m sorry to part with it. I get attached to my books, you
know; but they always have to go.”</p>

<p>He sighed with such an obvious genuineness of feeling that I repented of the judgment I
had passed upon him. He was a reluctant inhabitant of the infernal realms, even as was I
myself.</p>

<p>Outside they were beginning to cry the evening papers: a ship sunk, trenches captured,
somebody’s new stirring speech. We looked at one another—the old bookseller and I—in
silence. We understood one another without speech. Here were we in particular, and here
was the whole of humanity in general, all faced by the hideous triumph of things. In this
continued massacre of men, in this old man’s enforced sacrifice, matter equally triumphed.
And walking homeward through Regent’s Park, I too found matter triumphing over me. My book
was unconscionably heavy, and I wondered what in the world I should do with a piano score
of <i>Robert the Devil</i> <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-268">[Pg
268]</a></span>when I had got it home. It would only be another thing to weigh me down and
hinder me; and at the moment it was very, oh, abominably, heavy. I leaned over the
railings that ring round the ornamental water, and as unostentatiously as I could, I let
the book fall into the bushes.</p>

<p>I often think it would be best not to attempt the solution of the problem of life.
Living is hard enough without complicating the process by thinking about it. The wisest
thing, perhaps, is to take for granted the “wearisome condition of humanity, born under
one law, to another bound,” and to leave the matter at that, without an attempt to
reconcile the incompatibles. Oh, the absurd difficulty of it all! And I have, moreover,
wasted five shillings, which is serious, you know, in these thin times.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="no_sections" id="Death"><a href="#Death_toc">THE DEATH OF LULLY</a></h3>

<p class="noindent">T<small>HE</small> sea lay in a breathing calm, and the galley,
bosomed in its transparent water, stirred rhythmically to the slow pulse of its sleeping
life. Down below there, fathoms away through the crystal-clear Mediterranean, the shadow
of the ship lazily swung, moving, a long dark patch, very slowly back and forth across the
white sand of the sea-bottom—very slowly, a scarcely perceptible advance and recession of
the green darkness. Fishes sometimes passed, now hanging poised with idly tremulous fins,
now darting onwards, effortless and incredibly swift; and always, as it seemed, utterly
aimless, whether they rested or whether they moved; as the life of angels their life
seemed mysterious and unknowable.</p>

<p>All was silence on board the ship. In their fetid cage below decks the rowers slept
where they sat, chained, on their <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-270">[Pg 270]</a></span>narrow benches. On deck the sailors lay sleeping or sat
in little groups playing at dice. The fore-part of the deck was reserved, it seemed, for
passengers of distinction. Two figures, a man and a woman, were reclining there on
couches, their faces and half-bared limbs flushed in the coloured shadow that was thrown
by the great red awning stretched above them.</p>

<p>It was a nobleman, the sailors had heard, and his mistress that they had on board. They
had taken their passage at Scanderoon, and were homeward bound for Spain. Proud as sin
these Spaniards were; the man treated them like slaves or dogs. As for the woman, she was
well enough, but they could find as good a face and pair of breasts in their native Genoa.
If anyone so much as looked at her from half the ship’s length away it sent her possessor
into a rage. He had struck one man for smiling at her. Damned Catalonian, as jealous as a
stag; they wished him the stag’s horns as well as its temper.</p>

<p>It was intensely hot even under the awning. The man woke from his uneasy <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-271">[Pg 271]</a></span>sleep and reached out
to where on a little table beside him stood a deep silver cup of mixed wine and water. He
drank a gulp of it; it was as warm as blood and hardly cooled his throat. He turned over
and, leaning on his elbow, looked at his companion. She on her back, quietly breathing
through parted lips, still asleep. He leaned across and pinched her on the breast, so that
she woke up with a sudden start and cry of pain.</p>

<p>“Why did you wake me?” she asked.</p>

<p>He laughed and shrugged his shoulders. He had, indeed, had no reason for doing so,
except that he did not like it that she should be comfortably asleep, while he was awake
and unpleasantly conscious of the heat.</p>

<p>“It is hotter than ever,” he said, with a kind of gloomy satisfaction at the thought
that she would now have to suffer the same discomforts as himself. “The wine scorches
instead of cooling; the sun seems no lower down the sky.”</p>

<p>The woman pouted. “You pinched me cruelly,” she said. “And I still do not know why you
wanted to wake me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>He smiled again, this time with a good-humoured lasciviousness. “I wanted to kiss you,”
he said. He passed his hand over her body possessively, as a man might caress a dog.</p>

<p>Suddenly the quiet of the afternoon was shattered. A great clamour rose up, ragged and
uneven, on the air. Shrill yells pierced the dull rumbling growl of bass voices, pierced
the sound of beaten drums and hammered metal.</p>

<p>“What are they doing in the town?” asked the woman anxiously of her lover.</p>

<p>“God knows,” he answered. “Perhaps the heathen hounds are making some trouble with our
men.”</p>

<p>He got up and walked to the rail of the ship. A quarter of a mile away, across the
smooth water of the bay, stood the little African town at which they had stopped to call.
The sunlight showed everything with a hard and merciless definition. Sky, palms, white
houses, domes, and towers seemed as though made from some hard enamelled metal. A ridge of
low red hills rolled away to right and left. The sunshine gave to everything in the scene
the same <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-273">[Pg 273]</a></span>clarity
of detail, so that to the eye of the onlooker there was no impression of distance. The
whole thing seemed to be painted in flat upon a single plane.</p>

<p>The young man returned to his couch under the awning and lay down. It was hotter than
ever, or seemed so, at least, since he had made the exertion of getting up. He thought of
high cool pastures in the hills, with the pleasant sound of streams, far down and out of
sight in their deep channels. He thought of winds that were fresh and scented—winds that
were not mere breaths of dust and fire. He thought of the shade of cypresses, a narrow
opaque strip of darkness; and he thought too of the green coolness, more diffused and
fluid and transparent, of chestnut groves. And he thought of the people he remembered
sitting under the trees—young people, gay and brightly dressed, whose life was all gaiety
and deliciousness. There were the songs that they sang—he recalled the voices and the
dancing of the strings. And there were perfumes and, when one drew closer, the faint
intoxicating fragrance of a woman’s body. He thought of <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-274">[Pg 274]</a></span>the stories they told; one in particular
came to his mind, a capital tale of a sorcerer who offered to change a peasant’s wife into
a mare, and how he gulled the husband and enjoyed the woman before his eyes, and the
delightful excuses he made when she failed to change her shape. He smiled to himself at
the thought of it, and stretching out a hand touched his mistress. Her bosom was soft to
his fingers and damp with sweat; he had an unpleasant notion that she was melting in the
heat.</p>

<p>“Why do you touch me?” she asked.</p>

<p>He made no reply, but turned away from her. He wondered how it would come to pass that
people would rise again in the body. It seemed curious, considering the manifest
activities of worms. And suppose one rose in the body that one possessed in age. He
shuddered, picturing to himself what this woman would be like when she was sixty, seventy.
She would be beyond words repulsive. Old men too were horrible. They stank, and their eyes
were rheumy and rosiny, like the eyes of deer. He decided that he would kill himself
before he grew old. He was eight-and-twenty now. He would <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-275">[Pg 275]</a></span>give himself twelve years more. Then he
would end it. His thoughts dimmed and faded away into sleep.</p>

<p>The woman looked at him as he slept. He was a good man, she thought, though sometimes
cruel. He was different from all the other men she had known. Once, when she was sixteen
and a beginner in the business of love, she had thought that all men were always drunk
when they made love. They were all dirty and like beasts; she had felt herself superior to
them. But this man was a nobleman. She could not understand him; his thoughts were always
obscure. She felt herself infinitely inferior to him. She was afraid of him and his
occasional cruelty; but still he was a good man, and he might do what he liked with
her.</p>

<p>From far off came the sound of oars, a rhythmical splash and creak. Somebody shouted,
and from startlingly close at hand one of the sailors hallooed back.</p>

<p>The young man woke up with a start.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked, turning with an angry look to the girl, as though he held her
to be responsible for this breaking in upon his slumbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>“The boat, I think,” she said. “It must be coming back from the shore.”</p>

<p>The boat’s crew came up over the side, and all the stagnant life of the ship flowed
excitedly round them. They were the centre of a vortex towards which all were drawn. Even
the young Catalonian, for all his hatred of these stinking Genoese shipmen, was sucked
into the eddy. Everybody was talking at once, and in the general hubbub of question and
answer there was nothing coherent to be made out. Piercingly distinct above all the noise
came the voice of the little cabin-boy, who had been to shore with the boat’s crew. He was
running round to everyone in turn repeating: “I hit one of them. You know. I hit one. With
a stone on the forehead. Didn’t he bleed, ooh! didn’t he just!” And he would dance with
uncontrollable excitement.</p>

<p>The captain held up his hand and shouted for silence. “One at a time, there,” he
ordered, and when order had a little been restored, added grumblingly, “Like a pack of
dogs on a bone. You talk, boatswain.”</p>

<p>“I hit one of them,” said the boy. <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-277">[Pg 277]</a></span>Somebody cuffed him over the head, and he relapsed into
silence.</p>

<p>When the boatswain’s story had rambled through labyrinths of digression, over countless
obstacles of interruptions and emendations, to its conclusion, the Spaniard went back to
join his companion under the awning. He had assumed again his habitual indifference.</p>

<p>“Nearly butchered,” he said languidly, in response to her eager questions. “They”—he
jerked a hand in the direction of the town—“they were pelting an old fellow who had come
there preaching the Faith. Left him dead on the beach. Our men had to run for it.”</p>

<p>She could get no more out of him; he turned over and pretended to go to sleep.</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Towards evening they received a visit from the captain. He was a large, handsome man,
with gold ear-rings glinting from among a bush of black hair.</p>

<p>“Divine Providence,” he remarked sententiously, after the usual courtesies had passed,
“has called upon us to perform a very notable work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed?” said the young man.</p>

<p>“No less a work,” continued the captain, “than to save from the clutches of the
infidels and heathen the precious remains of a holy martyr.”</p>

<p>The captain let fall his pompous manner. It was evident that he had carefully prepared
these pious sentences, they rolled so roundly off his tongue. But he was eager now to get
on with his story, and it was in a homelier style that he went on: “If you knew these seas
as well as I—and it’s near twenty years now that I’ve been sailing them—you’d have some
knowledge of this same holy man that—God rot their souls for it!—these cursed Arabs have
done to death here. I’ve heard of him more than once in my time, and not always well
spoken of; for, to tell the honest truth, he does more harm with his preachments to good
Christian traders than ever he did good to black-hearted heathen dogs. Leave the bees
alone, I say, and if you can get a little honey out of them quietly, so much the better;
but he goes about among the beehives with a pole, stirring up trouble for himself <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-279">[Pg 279]</a></span>and others too. Leave
them alone to their damnation, is what I say, and get what you can from them this side of
hell. But, still, he has died a holy martyr’s death. God rest his soul! A martyr is a
wonderful thing, you know, and it’s not for the likes of us to understand what they mean
by it all.</p>

<p>“They do say, too, that he could make gold. And, to my mind, it would have been a thing
more pleasing to God and man if he had stopped at home minting money for poor folks and
dealing it round, so that there’d be no need to work any more and break oneself for a
morsel of bread. Yes, he was great at gold-making and at the books too. They tell me he
was called the Illuminated Doctor. But I know him still as plain Lully. I used to hear of
him from my father, plain Lully, and no better once than he should have been.</p>

<p>“My father was a shipwright in Minorca in those days—how long since? Fifty, sixty years
perhaps. He knew him then; he has often told me the tale. And a raffish young dog he was.
Drinking, drabbing, and dicing he outdid them <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-280">[Pg 280]</a></span>all, and between the bouts wrote poems, they say, which
was more than the rest could do. But he gave it all up on the sudden. Gave away his lands,
quitted his former companions, and turned hermit up in the hills, living alone like a fox
in his burrow, high up above the vines. And all because of a woman and his own qualmish
stomach.”</p>

<p>The shipmaster paused and helped himself to a little wine. “And what did this woman
do?” the girl asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s not what she did but what she didn’t do,” the captain answered, with a leer
and wink. “She kept him at his distance—all but once, all but once; and that was what put
him on the road to being a martyr. But there, I’m outrunning myself. I must go more
soberly.</p>

<p>“There was a lady of some consequence in the island—one of the Castellos, I think she
was; her first name has quite slipped my memory—Anastasia, or something of the kind. Lully
conceives a passion for her, and sighs and importunes her through I know not how many
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-281">[Pg 281]</a></span>months and
years. But her virtue stands steady as the judgment seat. Well, in the end, what happens
was this. The story leaked out after it was all over, and he was turned hermit in the
mountains. What happened, I say, was this. She tells him at last that he may come and see
her, fixing some solitary twilight place and time, her own room at nightfall. You can
guess how he washes and curls and scents himself, shaves his chin, chews anises, musks
over whatever of the goat may cling about the body. Off he goes, dreaming swoons and
ecstasies, foretasting inconceivable sweets. Arrived, he finds the lady a little
melancholy—her settled humour, but a man might expect a smile at such a time. Still,
nothing abashed, he falls at her feet and pours out his piteous case, telling her he has
sighed through seven years, not closed an eye for above a hundred nights, is forepined to
a shadow, and, in a word, will perish unless she show some mercy. She, still melancholy
her—settled humour, mark you—makes answer that she is ready to yield, and that her body is
entirely his. With that, she lets herself <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-282">[Pg 282]</a></span>be done with as he pleases, but always sorrowfully. ‘You
are all mine,’ says he—‘all mine’—and unlaces her gorgeret to prove the same. But he was
wrong. Another lover was already in her bosom, and his kisses had been passionate—oh,
burning passionate, for he had kissed away half her left breast. From the nipple down it
had all been gnawed away by a cancer.</p>

<p>“Bah, a man may see as bad as that any day in the street or at church-doors where
beggars most congregate. I grant you that it is a nasty sight, worm-eaten flesh, but
still—not enough, you will agree, to make yourself a hermit over. But there, I told you he
had a queasiness of the stomach. But doubtless it was all in God’s plan to make a holy
martyr of him. But for that same queasiness of his, he would still be living there, a
superannuated rake; or else have died in very foul odour, instead of passing, all embalmed
with sanctity, to Paradise Gate.</p>

<p>“I know not what happened to him between his hermit-hood and his quest for martyrdom. I
saw him first a dozen <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-283">[Pg
283]</a></span>years ago, down Tunis way. They were always clapping him into prison or
pulling out his beard for preaching. This time, it seems, they have made a holy martyr of
him, done the business thoroughly with no bungling. Well, may he pray for our souls at the
throne of God. I go in secretly to-night to steal his body. It lies on the shore there
beyond the jetty. It will be a notable work, I tell you, to bring back so precious a
corpse to Christendom. A most notable work. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>The captain rubbed his hands.</p>

<p class="transition">&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was after midnight, but there was still a bustle of activity on board the galley. At
any moment they were expecting the arrival of the boat with the corpse of the martyr. A
couch, neatly draped in black, with at its head and foot candles burning two by two, had
been set out on the poop for the reception of the body. The captain called the young
Spaniard and his mistress to come and see the bier.</p>

<p>“That’s a good bit of work for you,” he said, with justifiable pride. “I defy <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-284">[Pg 284]</a></span>anyone to make a more
decent resting-place for a martyr than that is. It could hardly have been done better on
shore, with every appliance at hand. But we sailors, you know, can make anything out of
nothing. A truckle-bed, a strip of tarred canvas, and four tallow dips from the cabin
lanterns—there you are, a bier for a king.”</p>

<p>He hurried away, and a little later the young man and the girl could hear him giving
orders and cursing somewhere down below. The candles burned almost without a tremor in the
windless air, and the reflections of the stars were long, thin tracks of fire along the
utterly calm water.</p>

<p>“Were there but perfumed flowers and the sound of a lute,” said the young Spaniard,
“the night would tremble into passion of its own accord. Love should come unsought on such
a night as this, among these black waters and the stars that sleep so peacefully on their
bosom.”</p>

<p>He put his arm round the girl and bent his head to kiss her. But she averted her face.
He could feel a shudder run her through the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not to-night,” she whispered. “I think of the poor dead man. I would rather pray.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” he cried. “Forget him. Remember only that we are alive, and that we have but
little time and none to waste.”</p>

<p>He drew her into the shadow under the bulwark, and, sitting down on a coil of rope,
crushed her body to his own and began kissing her with fury. She lay, at first, limp in
his arms, but gradually she kindled to his passion.</p>

<p>A plash of oars announced the approach of the boat. The captain hallooed into the
darkness: “Did you find him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we have him here,” came back the answer.</p>

<p>“Good. Bring him alongside and we’ll hoist him up. We have the bier in readiness. He
shall lie in state to-night.”</p>

<p>“But he’s not dead,” shouted back the voice from the night.</p>

<p>“Not dead?” repeated the captain, thunderstruck. “But what about the bier, then?”</p>

<p>A thin, feeble voice came back. “Your work will not be wasted, my friend. <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-286">[Pg 286]</a></span>It will be but a short
time before I need your bier.”</p>

<p>The captain, a little abashed, answered in a gentler tone, “We thought, holy father,
that the heathens had done their worst and that Almighty God had already given you the
martyr’s crown.”</p>

<p>By this time the boat had emerged from the darkness. In the stern sheets an old man was
lying, his white hair and beard stained with blood, his Dominican’s robe torn and fouled
with dust. At the sight of him, the captain pulled off his cap and dropped upon his
knees.</p>

<p>“Give us your blessing, holy father,” he begged.</p>

<p>The old man raised his hand and wished him peace.</p>

<p>They lifted him on board and, at his own desire, laid him upon the bier which had been
prepared for his dead body. “It would be a waste of trouble,” he said, “to put me anywhere
else, seeing I shall in any case be lying there so soon.”</p>

<p>So there he lay, very still under the four candles. One might have taken him for dead
already, but that his eyes, when he opened them, shone so brightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>He dismissed from the poop everyone except the young Spaniard. “We are countrymen,” he
said, “and of noble blood, both of us. I would rather have you near me than anyone
else.”</p>

<p>The sailors knelt for a blessing and disappeared; soon they could be heard weighing the
anchor; it was safest to be off before day. Like mourners at either side of the lighted
bier crouched the Spaniard and his mistress. The body of the old man, who was not yet
dead, lay quiet under the candles. The martyr was silent for some time, but at last he
opened his eyes and looked at the young man and the woman.</p>

<p>“I too,” he said, “was in love, once. In this year falls the jubilee of my last earthly
passion; fifty years have run since last I longed after the flesh—fifty years since God
opened my eyes to the hideousness of the corruption that man has brought upon himself.</p>

<p>“You are young, and your bodies are clean and straight, with no blotch or ulcer or
leprous taint to mar their much-desired beauty; but because of your outward <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-288">[Pg 288]</a></span>pride, your souls, it
may be, fester inwardly the more.</p>

<p>“And yet God made all perfect; it is but accident and the evil of will that causes
defaults. All metals should be gold, were it not that their elements willed evilly in
their desire to combine. And so with men: the burning sulphur of passion, the salt of
wisdom, the nimble mercurial soul should come together to make a golden being,
incorruptible and rustless. But the elements mingle jarringly, not in a pure harmony of
love, and gold is rare, while lead and iron and poisonous brass that leaves a taste as of
remorse behind it are everywhere common.</p>

<p>“God opened my eyes to it before my youth had too utterly wasted itself to rottenness.
It was half a hundred years ago, but I see her still, my Ambrosia, with her white, sad
face and her naked body and that monstrous ill eating away at her breast.</p>

<p>“I have lived since then trying to amend the evil, trying to restore, as far as my poor
powers would go, some measure of original perfection to the corrupted world. I have
striven to give to all metals their true <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-289">[Pg 289]</a></span>nature, to make true gold from the false, the unreal, the
accidental metals, lead and copper and tin and iron. And I have essayed that more
difficult alchemy, the transformation of men. I die now in my effort to purge away that
most foul dross of misbelief from the souls of these heathen men. Have I achieved
anything? I know not.”</p>

<p>The galley was moving now, its head turned seaward. The candles shivered in the wind of
its speed, casting uncertain, changing shadows upon his face. There was a long silence on
the poop. The oars creaked and splashed. Sometimes a shout would come up from below,
orders given by the overseer of the slaves, a curse, the sound of a blow. The old man
spoke again, more weakly now, as though to himself.</p>

<p>“I have had eighty years of it,” he said—“eighty years in the midst of this corroding
sea of hatred and strife. A man has need to keep pure and unalloyed his core of gold, that
little centre of perfection with which all, even in this declination of time, are born.
All other metal, though it be as tough as steel, <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-290">[Pg 290]</a></span>as shining-hard as brass, will melt before the devouring
bitterness of life. Hatred, lust, anger—the vile passions will corrode your will of iron,
the warlike pomp of your front of brass. It needs the golden perfection of pure love and
pure knowledge to withstand them.</p>

<p>“God has willed that I should be the stone—weak, indeed, in virtue—that has touched and
transformed at least a little of baser metal into the gold that is above corruption. But
it is hard work—thankless work. Man has made a hell of his world, and has set up gods of
pain to rule it. Goatish gods, that revel and feast on the agony of it all, poring over
the tortured world, like those hateful lovers, whose lust burns darkly into cruelty.</p>

<p>“Fever goads us through life in a delirium of madness. Thirsting for the swamps of evil
whence the fever came, thirsting for the mirages of his own delirium, man rushes headlong
he knows not whither. And all the time a devouring cancer gnaws at his entrails. It will
kill him in the end, when even the ghastly inspiration of fever will not be enough to whip
him on. He will lie there, <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-291">[Pg
291]</a></span>cumbering the earth, a heap of rottenness and pain, until at last the
cleansing fire comes to sweep the horror away.</p>

<p>“Fever and cancer; acids that burn and corrode. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have had eighty years
of it. Thank God, it is the end.”</p>

<p>It was already dawn; the candles were hardly visible now in the light, faded to
nothing, like souls in prosperity. In a little while the old man was asleep.</p>

<p>The captain tiptoed up on to the poop and drew the young Spaniard aside for a
confidential talk.</p>

<p>“Do you think he will die to-day?” he asked.</p>

<p>The young man nodded.</p>

<p>“God rest his soul,” said the captain piously. “But do you think it would be best to
take his body to Minorca or to Genoa? At Minorca they would give much to have their own
patron martyr. At the same time it would add to the glory of Genoa to possess so holy a
relic, though he is in no way connected with the place. It’s there is my difficulty.
Suppose, you see, that my people of Genoa did not want the body, he being from Minorca and
not one of them. I should <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-292">[Pg
292]</a></span>look a fool then, bringing it in in state. Oh, it’s hard, it’s hard.
There’s so much to think about. I am not sure but what I hadn’t better put in at Minorca
first. What do you think?”</p>

<p>The Spaniard shrugged his shoulder. “I have no advice to offer.”</p>

<p>“Lord,” said the captain as he bustled away, “life is a tangled knot to unravel.”</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
